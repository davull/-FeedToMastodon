If you’re already using other third-party hardware to run Assist, this will be a big upgrade. We prioritized its ability to hear commands, giving it an industry-leading dedicated audio processor and dual microphones - I’m always blown away by how well it picks up my voice around the room.</p>\n<p>Next, we ensured it would blend into the home, giving it a sleek but unobtrusive design. That’s not to say it doesn’t have flair. When you get your hands on Voice Preview Edition the first thing you’ll notice is its premium-feeling injection-molded shell, which is semi-transparent, just like your favorite ‘90s tech. The LED ring is also really eye-catching, and you can customize it to your heart’s content from full gamer RGB to subtle glow.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;\">\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/vpe-finish.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"3 different views of Voice Preview Edition\">\n</div>\n<p>It’s hard to convey how nice the rotary dial is to use; its subtle clicks paired with LED animations are hard not to play with. Most importantly, the dial lets anyone in your home intuitively adjust the volume. The same can be said for the multipurpose button and mute switch (which physically cuts power to the microphone for ultimate privacy). We knew for it to work best, it needed to be out in the open, and let’s just say that <a href=\"https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/open-home-approval-factor/#:~:text=2023.1%20release%20notes.-,Home%20Approval%20Factor,-We%20have%20a\">Home Approval Factor</a> was very front of mind when designing it.</p>\n<p>We also worked hard to keep the price affordable and comparable to other voice assistant hardware at just $59 (that’s the recommended MSRP, and pricing will vary by retailer). This isn’t a preorder, it’s available now!</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/vpe-price.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Voice Preview Edition price\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n  <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/buy-now.png\"\n         style=\"border: 0; box-shadow: none;\"\n         alt=\"buy now\">\n  </a>\n</div>\n<h3>Why Preview Edition</h3>\n<p>For some, our voice assistant is all they need; they just want to say a couple of commands, set timers, manage their shopping list, and control their most used devices. For others, we understand they want to ask their voice assistant to make whale sounds or to tell them how tall Taylor Swift is - this voice assistant doesn’t entirely do those things (<a href=\"/voice_control/assist_create_open_ai_personality/\">yet</a>). We think there is still more we can do before this is ready for every home, and until then, we’ll be selling this <em>Preview</em> of the future of voice assistants. We’ve built the best hardware on the market, and set a new standard for the coming years, allowing us to focus our development as we prepare our voice assistant for every home. Taking back our privacy isn’t for everyone - it’s a journey - and we want as many people as possible to join us early and make it better.</p>\n<h3>Built for Home Assistant</h3>\n<p>Many other voice assistants work with Home Assistant, but this one was <em>built</em> for Home Assistant. Unlike other voice hardware that can work with Assist, this doesn’t require flashing firmware or any assembly. You plug it into power, and it is seamlessly discovered by Home Assistant. A wizard instantly starts helping you set up your voice assistant, but critically, if you haven’t used voice before, it will quickly guide you through what you need to get the best experience.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/wizard.webp' alt=\"Video of Assist wizard\">Get up and running with Voice Preview Edition in minutes with our new wizard</a>\n<p>This is not a DIY product. We’ve worked to make the experience as smooth as possible, with easy and fast updates and settings you can manage from the Home Assistant UI.</p>\n<h3>Advanced audio processing</h3>\n<p>If you have been following our work on voice, you know we’ve tried a lot of different voice assistant hardware. Most available Assist-capable hardware is bad at its most important job - hearing your voice and then providing audiovisual feedback. That was really what drove us to build Voice Preview Edition.</p>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"DS_8cDZKBPc\" videotitle=\"Music Assistant - VPE\"></lite-youtube>Voice Preview Editions mics and audio processors effortlessly hear commands through loud music it is playing</p>\n<p>Our Assist software could only do so much with substandard audio, and its functionality is massively improved with clear audio. The dual microphones combined with the XMOS audio processing chip are what makes it so capable. Together, they allow Voice Preview Edition to have echo cancellation, stationary noise removal, and auto gain control, which all adds up to clearer audio. This combined with an ESP32-S3 with 8 MB of octal PSRAM - one of the fastest ESP and RAM combinations available - makes for an incredibly responsive device. This is the best Assist hardware you can buy today, and it will continue to give a great experience as Assist’s feature set expands in the years to come.</p>\n<h3>Bringing choice to voice</h3>\n<p>Assist can do something almost no other voice assistant can achieve - <em>it can run without the internet</em> 🤯. You can speak to your Voice Preview Edition, and those commands can be processed completely within the walls of your home. At the time of writing this, there are some pretty big caveats, specifically that you need to speak a <a href=\"/voice-pe/#language-support\">supported language</a> and have pretty powerful hardware to run it (we recommend a Home Assistant system running on an Intel N100 or better).</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/local-cloud.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"graphic of local vs cloud\">Diagram of cloud vs local speech processing</p>\n<p>If you use low-powered Home Assistant hardware, there is an easy and affordable internet-based solution; <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. This privacy-focused service allows you to offload your speech-to-text and text-to-speech processing, all while being very responsive and keeping your energy bill low. Speech-to-text is the harder of the two to run locally, and our cloud processing is almost always more accurate for more languages (visit our <a href=\"/voice-pe/#language-support\">language support checker here</a>).</p>\n<p>Our goal is for Assist to run easily, affordably, and fully locally for all languages. As someone who has seen the rapid development of this technology over the past several years, I’m optimistic that this will happen, but until then, many languages have a good range of choices that provide strong privacy.</p>\n<h3>Fully open and customizable</h3>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/3d-prints.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Some interesting cartoon-inspired 3D prints for Voice Preview Edition\">We are sharing the design files if you want to 3D print a new case... these ones were inevitable</p>\n<p>We’re not just launching a new product, <em><strong>we’re open sourcing all of it</strong></em>. We built this for the Home Assistant community. Our community doesn’t want a single voice assistant, they want the one that works for them – they want choice. Creating a voice assistant is hard, and until now, parts of the solution were locked behind expensive licenses and proprietary software. With Voice Preview Edition being open source, we hope to bootstrap an ecosystem of voice assistants.</p>\n<p>We tried to make every aspect of Voice Preview Edition customizable, which is actually pretty easy when you’re working hand-in-hand with ESPHome and Home Assistant.

The included DAC is very clean and capable of streaming lossless audio. It can also be used as a very capable ESP32 device. On the bottom of the device is a <a href=\"https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/\">Grove port</a> (concealed under a cover that can be permanently removed), which allows you to connect a large ecosystem of sensors and accessories.</p>\n<p>We’ve also made it quite painless to open, with easy-to-access screws and no clips.

    "raw": "<img src='/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/art.png' alt=\"Voice chapter 8 - Assist in the home today\">\n<p>As you have probably already read, we launched our <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a> today. The culmination of the past several years of open-source software progress on Home Assistant’s home-grown voice assistant, <a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist</a>. A sizable group of dedicated developers has been working together on adding and honing its many features, and if it’s been a while since you tried Assist, you should use this launch as a chance to jump back in and see the progress we’ve made.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a> has been launched to build on this work, continuing the momentum we’ve already built and accelerating our goal of not only matching the capabilities of existing voice assistants but surpassing them. We had an early production run of Voice Preview Edition (a preview preview 😉), and we tried to get them in the hands of as many of our language leaders and voice developers as possible - and we’re already seeing the fruits of their efforts with language support improving over the past month alone!</p>\n<p>I’d like to highlight in this voice chapter all the things you can do with Assist today. I also want to give the state of our development, what the limitations are, and where your support can be best applied.</p>\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#assist-in-the-home-today\">Assist in the home today</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#origins-of-assist\">Origins of Assist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#commands\">Commands</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#timers\">Timers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#exposing-devices-and-aliases\">Exposing devices and Aliases</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#room-context\">Room context</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#wake-words\">Wake words</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#speech-processing\">Speech Processing</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#language-support\">Language support</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#text-to-speech\">Text-to-speech</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#speech-to-text\">Speech-to-text</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#ai-and-assist\">AI and Assist</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Assist in the home today</h2>\n<h3>Origins of Assist</h3>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/assist.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Early Assist being used in chat\">Early versions of Assist via chat - things have come a long way</p>\n<p>Voice control for Home Assistant goes back further than most people assume, with some of the groundwork we use today being <a href=\"/blog/2017/07/29/release-50/\">added as far back as 2017</a>. The major turning point came when we refocused our efforts and declared 2023 the <a href=\"/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/\">Year of the Voice</a>. This was an effort to focus development and find areas where our community could make the most impact. During the Year of the Voice <a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist</a> was added to voice, intents were improved, languages added, wake words were created, and we established great local and cloud options for running voice. Shortly after Year of the Voice many more features were added, including integrated AI, timers, and even better wake words. Year of the Voice got the ball rolling, and Voice Preview Edition will continue its momentum.</p>\n<h3>Commands</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist</a> is the underlying technology that allows Home Assistant to turn commands (“turn on the light”) into Actions (<code>light.turn_on</code>). Commands, or as we call them <em>intents</em>, allow you to control pretty much every aspect of your smart home, including on, off, play, pause, next, open, close, and more. We also have intents that give you helpful information like what’s the time, weather, temperature, and so on. Lastly, there are a bunch of other useful miscellaneous things, like adding items to a shopping list and setting timers. If you’re interested, there is a <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/intent_builtin/\">full list here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Timers</h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <video src=\"/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/timer.webm\"\n         autoplay muted loop playsinline>\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n  </video>\n</div>\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/poll-what-do-you-use-your-voice-assistant-for-what-do-you-expect-it-to-do-multiple-selections/693669\">asked our community</a> timers were a top-requested ability. You can not only set a timer, pause, increase, decrease or cancel it, but you can also set commands to <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/26/voice-chapter-7/#timers-control-devices\">trigger after a set amount of time</a>, for example, “turn off the TV in 15 minutes”. You can also just say “Stop” without a wake word, to silence the timer’s alarm. On our Voice Preview Edition, when you set a timer the LED ring counts down the last seconds and flashes when it’s done.</p>\n<h3>Exposing devices and Aliases</h3>\n<p>This sets us apart from other voice assistants: we allow you to expose and effectively hide devices from your voice assistant. For example, you could choose not to expose a door lock but instead just expose the sensor that knows if the door is closed. It puts you in the driver’s seat on what voice can do in your home. We also introduced aliases to allow you to give devices multiple names, allowing you to speak more naturally with Assist.</p>\n<h3>Room context</h3>\n<p>If you tell your Assist hardware what room it is in and ensure other devices are organized by room, you can give commands like “turn off the lights”, and without specifying anything, it will turn off the lights in the room you are in. This feature also works with media players (play/pause/next) and timers.</p>\n<h3>Wake words</h3>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/wake-word.webp' style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\" alt=\"Timer animation video\"><br>Our community is donating small amounts of time to improve wake words <a href=\"/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/\" target=\"_blank\">with our tool</a>.</br></a>\n<p>Wake Words are the unique phrases that initiate a voice assistant to listen and start processing a command. Wake words originally had to be processed on Home Assistant via an add-on like openWakeWord, meaning the Assist hardware needed to continuously stream audio to Home Assistant. Shortly after Year of the Voice <a href=\"/blog/2024/02/21/voice-chapter-6/#microwakeword\">microWakeWord</a> was released, which brought wake word processing on-device for faster responses. It is improving fast thanks to our community using our <a href=\"/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/\">fast and easy tool</a> to donate samples of their voice. There is a growing list of wake words, and  the on-device options include “Okay Nabu” (default and most reliable), “Hey Jarvis”, and “Hey Mycroft”. Both of these wake word engines were built by the Home Assistant community and are open source, giving the world two great free and open wake word engines!</p>\n<h2>Speech Processing</h2>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/voice-pipeline.png' alt=\"Timer animation video\">The Assist pipeline in all its glory</a>\n<p>Assist can’t understand spoken words and needs something to take that audio and turn it into text - all this together is called an Assist pipeline. This speech processing is really CPU intensive, so it can’t happen on the Voice Assistant Hardware, and sometimes your Home Assistant system can’t even handle it. One important step we made was adding speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities to <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, which allows low-powered Home Assistant hardware to offload speech processing to the cloud. Home Assistant Cloud doesn’t store or use this data to train on - clouds don’t get any more private than ours. It is also the most accurate and power-efficient way to process speech. We’ve put considerable effort into local speech processing, building the add-ons and a new protocol they use to speak to Home Assistant, but they are very reliant on language support from the community.</p>\n<h3>Language support</h3>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/language-support.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Our language checker\">See if your language is supported with <a href=\"/voice-pe/#language-support\" target=\"_blank\">our checker</a>.</p>\n<p>Assist aims to support more languages than other voice assistants, and this has been a massive undertaking for our community - We need more help. The first step for language support is getting the commands (intents) right, and we have <a href=\"https://home-assistant.github.io/intents/\">over 25 major languages</a> that are ready to use today. Our wake words are also getting better at understanding different accents thanks to our <a href=\"https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/\">Wake Word Collective tool</a>.</p>\n<h3>Text-to-speech</h3>\n<p>We built our own text-to-speech system, <a href=\"/integrations/piper/\">Piper</a>, and it now supports over 30 languages. It’s a fast, local neural network-powered text-to-speech system that sounds great and can run on low-powered hardware (it’s optimized for Pi4!). It was built with the voices of our community, and if you don’t see your native tongue, <a href=\"https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/blob/master/TRAINING.md\">add your voice</a>!</p>\n<h3>Speech-to-text</h3>\n<p>There is one area that holds back the rest of our language support more than others, and that’s local speech-to-text. Building a full speech-to-text model needs big compute resources and terabytes of samples, which is currently outside our reach. We use <a href=\"/integrations/whisper/\">Whisper</a> for local speech-to-text processing, an open-source project from OpenAI, and we’re grateful it exists. For some languages, it works great and doesn’t require a lot of system resources to run well, but for others, you need a pretty beefy system to get acceptable results. In our opinion, only about 15 languages are ready to be run locally on reasonable hardware (an Intel N100 or better) - that’s why before you begin dreaming up your perfect all-local setup, we recommend checking <a href=\"/voice-pe/#language-support\">language support</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re always looking for new solutions for low-powered hardware, and are now building another tool that uses much less complex sentence recognition. This could even run on a Raspberry Pi 4, but it would only be able to identify predefined sentences, so if you go off script you may need to call in an AI to help Assist understand your needs. Our language leaders are hard at work putting together the needed translations, but if you want to learn more visit <a href=\"https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy-speech\">Rhasspy Speech</a>.</p>\n<p>In general, even when your language is supported, you’ll almost always get better results from Home Assistant Cloud. Use the free trial to see what works best for you. Also, you can use both, we know someone using an automation to switch the Assist pipeline to an all local setup when their internet is down.</p>\n<h3>AI and Assist</h3>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"vThoxRIxHyI\" videotitle=\"Assist working with AI\"></lite-youtube>Our default local conversation agent mixed with AI is great for natural language and speed</p>\n<p>Another aspect where we beat the competition hands down is the integration of AI into our voice assistant. You can choose from some of the biggest cloud AI providers like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Claude (paid accounts required). You can also run it locally via <a href=\"https://ollama.com/\">Ollama</a> if you have a modern graphics processor with enough VRAM, allowing you to build the most capable offline voice setup around.</p>\n<p>Our intents (Assist’s built-in sentences) are getting better at understanding most commands, but AI processes commands in natural language, meaning if you get the device’s name ever so slightly off, it can still figure things out. It also provides the ability to ask outside the built-in intents. For instance, if you tell it “It’s a bit cold in here”, it may raise the temperature on your thermostat, but it could forgo any home control and just tell you to put on a jacket - results are not yet consistent. More useful is its ability to take multiple sensors and provide context. For instance, you could ask it for an air quality report, and it could review the CO2 levels and tell you to open a window it observes is shut. All this is experimental, and having an AI control your home is not for everyone, but what’s important is that you have the choice.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So many new innovations and improvements for Assist have happened in the past couple of months, and this speaks to the power of having good hardware to build our software on. Voice Preview Edition is the best open voice hardware available today, and even with it only in the hands of a couple of hundred people today, it’s making a noticeable difference. Whether that’s writing code, improving language support, making blueprints, or even just reporting bugs. The momentum we will build having this in the hands of thousands will be game-changing - it’s why we’ve declared that the era of open voice assistants has arrived.</p>\n<p>In the comments sections, we always have a couple of people saying, “but I don’t use voice, what about improving (this or that)”. The good news is that improving Assist and Home Assistant’s other features are already happening in tandem (check out <a href=\"/blog/2024/11/15/roadmap-2024h2/\">our roadmap</a> for the complete picture of our priorities). In the end, only a fraction of our development goes towards voice, and our budget is what Amazon’s voice team probably spends on pizza parties 😆. A great side effect is the problems we’re solving with voice are benefiting other parts of Home Assistant, for example, our integration of AI was driven by voice.</p>\n<p>We really think voice is an integral part of a well-rounded smart home ecosystem. It’s especially important for improving the accessibility of home control to all members of the household. There needs to be real options in the space, most importantly ones that give you full control and a real choice on privacy.</p>\n<h3>Home Assistant Voice Preview is available at retailers today,<!-- omit in toc --></h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/vpe-packaging.png\"\n       alt=\"Voice Preview Edition with packaging\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n  <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/buy-now.png\"\n         style=\"border: 0; box-shadow: none;\"\n         alt=\"buy now\">\n  </a>\n</div>\n",
    "sanitized": "As you have probably already read, we launched our Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition today. The culmination of the past several years of open-source software progress on Home Assistant’s home-grown voice assistant, Assist. A sizable group of dedicated developers has been working together on adding and honing its many features, and if it’s been a while since you tried Assist, you should use this launch as a chance to jump back in and see the progress we’ve made.\nHome Assistant Voice Preview Edition has been launched to build on this work, continuing the momentum we’ve already built and accelerating our goal of not only matching the capabilities of existing voice assistants but surpassing them. We had an early production run of Voice Preview Edition (a preview preview 😉), and we tried to get them in the hands of as many of our language leaders and voice developers as possible - and we’re already seeing the fruits of their efforts with language support improving over the past month alone!\nI’d like to highlight in this voice chapter all the things you can do with Assist today. I also want to give the state of our development, what the limitations are, and where your support can be best applied.\nTable of Contents\n\nAssist in the home today\n\nOrigins of Assist\nCommands\nTimers\nExposing devices and Aliases\nRoom context\nWake words\n\n\nSpeech Processing\n\nLanguage support\nText-to-speech\nSpeech-to-text\nAI and Assist\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nAssist in the home today\nOrigins of Assist\nEarly versions of Assist via chat - things have come a long way\nVoice control for Home Assistant goes back further than most people assume, with some of the groundwork we use today being added as far back as 2017. The major turning point came when we refocused our efforts and declared 2023 the Year of the Voice. This was an effort to focus development and find areas where our community could make the most impact. During the Year of the Voice Assist was added to voice, intents were improved, languages added, wake words were created, and we established great local and cloud options for running voice. Shortly after Year of the Voice many more features were added, including integrated AI, timers, and even better wake words. Year of the Voice got the ball rolling, and Voice Preview Edition will continue its momentum.\nCommands\nAssist is the underlying technology that allows Home Assistant to turn commands (“turn on the light”) into Actions (light.turn_on). Commands, or as we call them intents, allow you to control pretty much every aspect of your smart home, including on, off, play, pause, next, open, close, and more. We also have intents that give you helpful information like what’s the time, weather, temperature, and so on. Lastly, there are a bunch of other useful miscellaneous things, like adding items to a shopping list and setting timers. If you’re interested, there is a full list here.\nTimers\n\n  \n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n  \n\nWhen we asked our community timers were a top-requested ability. You can not only set a timer, pause, increase, decrease or cancel it, but you can also set commands to trigger after a set amount of time, for example, “turn off the TV in 15 minutes”. You can also just say “Stop” without a wake word, to silence the timer’s alarm. On our Voice Preview Edition, when you set a timer the LED ring counts down the last seconds and flashes when it’s done.\nExposing devices and Aliases\nThis sets us apart from other voice assistants: we allow you to expose and effectively hide devices from your voice assistant. For example, you could choose not to expose a door lock but instead just expose the sensor that knows if the door is closed. It puts you in the driver’s seat on what voice can do in your home. We also introduced aliases to allow you to give devices multiple names, allowing you to speak more naturally with Assist.\nRoom context\nIf you tell your Assist hardware what room it is in and ensure other devices are organized by room, you can give commands like “turn off the lights”, and without specifying anything, it will turn off the lights in the room you are in. This feature also works with media players (play/pause/next) and timers.\nWake words\nOur community is donating small amounts of time to improve wake words with our tool.\nWake Words are the unique phrases that initiate a voice assistant to listen and start processing a command. Wake words originally had to be processed on Home Assistant via an add-on like openWakeWord, meaning the Assist hardware needed to continuously stream audio to Home Assistant. Shortly after Year of the Voice microWakeWord was released, which brought wake word processing on-device for faster responses. It is improving fast thanks to our community using our fast and easy tool to donate samples of their voice. There is a growing list of wake words, and  the on-device options include “Okay Nabu” (default and most reliable), “Hey Jarvis”, and “Hey Mycroft”. Both of these wake word engines were built by the Home Assistant community and are open source, giving the world two great free and open wake word engines!\nSpeech Processing\nThe Assist pipeline in all its glory\nAssist can’t understand spoken words and needs something to take that audio and turn it into text - all this together is called an Assist pipeline. This speech processing is really CPU intensive, so it can’t happen on the Voice Assistant Hardware, and sometimes your Home Assistant system can’t even handle it.

We’ve put considerable effort into local speech processing, building the add-ons and a new protocol they use to speak to Home Assistant, but they are very reliant on language support from the community.\nLanguage support\nSee if your language is supported with our checker.\nAssist aims to support more languages than other voice assistants, and this has been a massive undertaking for our community - We need more help.

You can then switch to the\n“edit mode”; only then will the scene activate, allowing you to adjust the\nactual scenery and snapshot it again once you are happy with the changes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you prefer <span class='terminology'>YAML<span class='terminology-tooltip'>YAML is a human-readable data serialization language.

Not just with the features\nthat ship in this release, but you might have heard about our voice hardware\nthat is coming soon…</p>\n<p>With some help from Santa 🎅 and his elves, we have prepared a product launch\nYouTube live stream on 19 December 2024, at 20:00 GMT / 12:00 PT / 21:00 CET!</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"ZgoaoTpIhm8\" videotitle=\"Product Launch 🗣️ Voice: Chapter 8\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<p>Curious?

You really\ndon’t want to miss this one!</p>\n<p>But before we get there, let’s dive into the features that ship in this release!</p>\n<h3>Let your voice assistant fall back to an LLM-based agent</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/\">Exactly 6 months ago</a>, we bridged the gap between our default conversation agent\nand the wonderful (and scary) world of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model\">LLMs</a>. We allowed you to experiment and\nlet an LLM-based conversation agent control your home instead of relying on our\nbuilt-in sentences.</p>\n<p>This choice was an interesting first step. LLMs are generally much better at\ninterpreting natural language and more knowledgeable about the world than our\ndefault agent. However, they are often slow and/or expensive. And let’s face it:\nEven if the demos are cool, 90% of the commands we say in our homes are simple:\n<em>“Turn this on”</em> or <em>“Turn that off”</em>.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re finally allowing users to <strong>mix</strong> these worlds. Starting from this\nrelease, you can set up a voice assistant that targets our fast,\ncommunity-driven conversation agent first and only falls back to an LLM-based\nagent if no matches are found.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Dialog showing the Assist pipeline configuration, showing the new option to prefer handling commands locally.\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-12/llm-fallback-configuration.png\"/>\n<p>This allows you to mix the pros of both worlds with almost none of the cons.</p>\n<p>Specific known commands will be processed locally and extremely fast, and the\npower of an LLM will only be used for more complex queries that Home Assistant\ndoes not natively understand.</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"vThoxRIxHyI\" videotitle=\"Let your voice assistant fall back to an LLM-based agent\" posterquality=\"maxresdefault\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<h3>Language leaders are accelerating the pace</h3>\n<p>It is no secret: our voice hardware will be revealed on 19 December 2024.\nLanguage leaders have already got their hands on the device, and are working\nextremely hard to polish support for their language.</p>\n<p>The number of contributions to our <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/intents?tab=readme-ov-file\">intents repository</a> (where we store the\nsupported sentences) skyrocketed during the last month, which we all truly\nappreciate. More and more languages are becoming usable or even complete!\nYou can follow the progress <a href=\"https://home-assistant.github.io/intents/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We won’t list them all, but rest assured, someone is likely working hard to\nensure your native language works seamlessly, so you can use it comfortably\nat home.</p>\n<h3>A faster voice experience</h3>\n<p>Our default conversation agent was built from the ground up to match a sentence\nto its underlying intention extremely fast and on cheap hardware.</p>\n<p>Release after release, we added more use cases and sentences to Home Assistant,\nand our sentence-matching logic became slower and slower. In some languages,\na non-matching sentence could take more than 15 seconds to process!</p>\n<p>This release adds a lot of love to this matching logic; we completely\nreengineered the way we match sentences. On top of that, language leaders spent\nsome time reducing the complexity of their sentences. Some languages saw a 99%\nreduction in the number of possible combinations!</p>\n<p>The results speak for themselves:</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"RH69Dh6coMM\" videotitle=\"A faster voice experience with our default conversation agent\" posterquality=\"maxresdefault\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<h2>Revised Integration Quality Scale</h2>\n<p>The Integration Quality Scale (IQS) is a way we classify the “quality” of an\nintegration. It gives users an idea of what to expect from an integration.\nYou might have noticed our IQS indicator listed on\n<a href=\"/integrations/homewizard\">each integration documentation page</a>.</p>\n<p>The scale was initially introduced in 2018 and aimed more at the technical\nside and code of an integration back then. Over the years, it didn’t\nreally evolve with the rest of Home Assistant and the general expectations of\nour community. It was time for a change!</p>\n<p>Over the last few months, we have worked with the community to revise and\nimprove the scale. Involving not just our community developers but also\ndocumentation writers, user experience designers, and anyone interested\nin the community.</p>\n<p>As a result, the new Integration Quality Scale is not just focused on the code\nbut even more on the overall user experience. It is now a more holistic view\nof the integration, and we hope it will help everyone make better decisions\nabout what to use in their homes.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"The integration quality scale is also shown in the Home Assistant UI now. The image shows the HomeWizard Energy integration scoring platinum on the new integration quality scale.\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-12/integration-quality-scale.png\" />\n<p>We now have a total of 4 scaled tiers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>🥉 <a href=\"/docs/quality_scale/#-bronze\">Bronze</a></strong>:\nThe new minimum set of requirements we’ve set for new integrations.</li>\n<li><strong>🥈 <a href=\"/docs/quality_scale/#-silver\">Silver</a></strong>:\nEnsuring reliability and robustness of integrations.</li>\n<li><strong>🥇 <a href=\"/docs/quality_scale/#-gold\">Gold</a></strong>:\nEnsuring a gold standard user experience, including documentation.</li>\n<li><strong>🏆 <a href=\"/docs/quality_scale/#-platinum\">Platinum</a></strong>:\nThe epitome of quality, supreme code quality, and optimal performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also have four additional (non-scaled) special tiers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>❓ <a href=\"/docs/quality_scale/#-no-score\">No score</a></strong>:\nFor integrations that are not yet scored against the new scale.</li>\n<li><strong>🏠 <a href=\"/docs/quality_scale/#-internal\">Internal</a></strong>\nFor integrations Home Assistant itself uses, like the automation engine.</li>\n<li><strong>💾 <a href=\"/docs/quality_scale/#-legacy\">Legacy</a></strong>\nFor older integrations that can’t be set up through the UI.</li>\n<li><strong>📦 <a href=\"/docs/quality_scale/#-custom\">Custom</a></strong>\nFor custom integrations, as we can’t score those.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can read all about these tiers, what they have been designed for, and a\nsummary of their characteristics on our dedicated\n<a href=\"/docs/quality_scale/\">Integration Quality Scale page</a>.</p>\n<p>We sincerely hope this new scale will not just help our users, but also our\ncommunity developers to understand what is expected by providing a clear path\nto improving their integrations. To help with that, we have now\n<a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/#integration-quality-scale-rules\">extensively documented every rule and requirement for each tier in our\ndeveloper documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Translations for units of measurement</h2>\n<p>Over the last few years, we have been working hard to make every little\nbit of Home Assistant accessible for everyone by providing translations\nfor every part of the system. 🌐</p>\n<p>However, we still have some edge cases, where we are not able to provide\ntranslations for everything. One of those edge cases is the units of\nmeasurement. 📏</p>\n<p>Although units do not need translation (like <code>°C</code> or <code>kWh</code>) in most cases, many\nsensors in a home might use specific and non-standardized units. For example,\na sensor that measures the number of “people” in a home or one that tells you\nhow many “movies” are in your collection.</p>\n<p>So, suppose you now have a sensor with a custom measurement unit, like the\namount of “movies” in your collection. In that case, integrations can now\nprovide translations for those units. 🎉</p>\n<p>Several integrations have already added translations for their units, including\n<a href=\"/integrations/jellyfin\">Jellyfin</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/squeezebox\">Lyrion Music Server</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/transmission\">Transmission</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/pi_hole\">Pi-hole</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/qbittorrent\">QBitTorrent</a>,\n<a href=\"/integrations/nextdns\">NextDNS</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/mastodon\">Mastodon</a>, and <a href=\"/integrations/mealie\">Mealie</a>!</p>\n<h2>We’ve upgraded to Python 3.13</h2>\n<center><img class=\"no-shadow\" style=\"width: 65%\" alt=\"The Python logo; Home Assistant now runs on top of Python latest 3.13 update\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-12/python.png\"/></center>\n<p>This release comes packaged with Python 3.13!  🐍</p>\n<p>Wondering what that means? Python is the programming language that powers Home\nAssistant behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>Why does it matter? Every new Python release brings improvements that we can\ntap into—better performance, fewer bugs, and a smoother developer experience\nfor our contributors. Plus, Python 3.13 offers a speed boost to Home Assistant\noverall—what’s not to love? 🚀</p>\n<p>Running Home Assistant OS or using the Home Assistant Container? No sweat—we’ve\ngot you covered. The upgrade to Python 3.13 is handled automatically. Just\nupdate Home Assistant as usual, and you’re good to go.</p>\n<p>Easy, right? 😎</p>\n<h2>Patch releases</h2>\n<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.12 in December.\nThese patch releases only contain bug fixes.

    "sanitized": "Home Assistant 2024.12! 🎄\nHolidays are coming, and it is time for the last release of the year! 🎉\n2024 has been a crazy year for Home Assistant. Not just in terms of features\nlike drag-and-drop dashboards, organization capabilities like labels, and\nthe countless improvements to our voice efforts. But also the founding of\nthe Open Home Foundation, and even more in the growth of our lovely community\nas we’ve risen up to become the #1 open source project on GitHub! ❤️\nHowever, the year ain’t over yet! This month, we want to learn about all your\n“What the heck?!” moments with Home Assistant. Tell us about any little\nannoyances, bugs, ideas, or suggestions. You can read all about it in\nthe WTH announcement blog, or join the conversation on our WTH forums!\nHonestly, the biggest announcement of the year has yet to come though… 🤫\nI’m pretty sure it is voice hardware related. 😉 So make sure you aren’t\nmissing the live stream on 19 December! 📺 You will not be disappointed! 🎁\nBefore you check out everything in this release, I just want to close this\nyear with a big thank you to every single person in our community, which\nincludes you!\nThank you for using Home Assistant! ❤️\nHappy holidays!

For example, a scene can specify that light A should be turned on and light B should be bright red. [Learn more] are a great way to set the mood in your home. They allow you\nto capture the state of your devices at a specific moment and restore it\nlater, using a button on your dashboard, an automation, or even a voice command.\nOne of the common frustrations with editing scenes in Home Assistant is that it\nwould immediately activate and apply the scene if you opened the scene editor.\nNot the best experience if you are doing some midnight tinkering and\naccidentally activate a scene that turns on all the lights in the house,\nwaking up everyone. 😅\n@karwosts & @marcinbauer85 to the rescue! 🦸‍♂️ As of this release, the scene\neditor has two modes. A review mode and an edit mode.\n\nThe “review mode” is how your scene will open, and it will show you the scene as\nit is currently set up, but it will not apply it. You can then switch to the\n“edit mode”; only then will the scene activate, allowing you to adjust the\nactual scenery and snapshot it again once you are happy with the changes.\nAdditionally, if you prefer YAMLYAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the configuration.yaml or automations.yaml files. [Learn more], you can edit scenes directly from\nthe scene editor by selecting “Edit in YAML” from the three-dotted\n overflow menu in the top right corner.\nVoice\nIt has almost been two years since we started our journey into building our\nvery own open source voice assistants, with the goal of letting users control\nHome Assistant in their own language.\nToday, we are getting even closer to the finish line. Not just with the features\nthat ship in this release, but you might have heard about our voice hardware\nthat is coming soon…\nWith some help from Santa 🎅 and his elves, we have prepared a product launch\nYouTube live stream on 19 December 2024, at 20:00 GMT / 12:00 PT / 21:00 CET!\n\nCurious? Be sure to join the live stream, hit like 👍, subscribe to our\nchannel, and the little bell 🔔 to get notified when we go live! You really\ndon’t want to miss this one!\nBut before we get there, let’s dive into the features that ship in this release!\nLet your voice assistant fall back to an LLM-based agent\nExactly 6 months ago, we bridged the gap between our default conversation agent\nand the wonderful (and scary) world of LLMs. We allowed you to experiment and\nlet an LLM-based conversation agent control your home instead of relying on our\nbuilt-in sentences.\nThis choice was an interesting first step. LLMs are generally much better at\ninterpreting natural language and more knowledgeable about the world than our\ndefault agent. However, they are often slow and/or expensive. And let’s face it:\nEven if the demos are cool, 90% of the commands we say in our homes are simple:\n“Turn this on” or “Turn that off”.\nToday, we’re finally allowing users to mix these worlds. Starting from this\nrelease, you can set up a voice assistant that targets our fast,\ncommunity-driven conversation agent first and only falls back to an LLM-based\nagent if no matches are found.\n\nThis allows you to mix the pros of both worlds with almost none of the cons.\nSpecific known commands will be processed locally and extremely fast, and the\npower of an LLM will only be used for more complex queries that Home Assistant\ndoes not natively understand.\n\nLanguage leaders are accelerating the pace\nIt is no secret: our voice hardware will be revealed on 19 December 2024.\nLanguage leaders have already got their hands on the device, and are working\nextremely hard to polish support for their language.\nThe number of contributions to our intents repository (where we store the\nsupported sentences) skyrocketed during the last month, which we all truly\nappreciate. More and more languages are becoming usable or even complete!\nYou can follow the progress here.\nWe won’t list them all, but rest assured, someone is likely working hard to\nensure your native language works seamlessly, so you can use it comfortably\nat home.\nA faster voice experience\nOur default conversation agent was built from the ground up to match a sentence\nto its underlying intention extremely fast and on cheap hardware.\nRelease after release, we added more use cases and sentences to Home Assistant,\nand our sentence-matching logic became slower and slower. In some languages,\na non-matching sentence could take more than 15 seconds to process!\nThis release adds a lot of love to this matching logic; we completely\nreengineered the way we match sentences. On top of that, language leaders spent\nsome time reducing the complexity of their sentences. Some languages saw a 99%\nreduction in the number of possible combinations!\nThe results speak for themselves:\n\nRevised Integration Quality Scale\nThe Integration Quality Scale (IQS) is a way we classify the “quality” of an\nintegration. It gives users an idea of what to expect from an integration.\nYou might have noticed our IQS indicator listed on\neach integration documentation page.\nThe scale was initially introduced in 2018 and aimed more at the technical\nside and code of an integration back then. Over the years, it didn’t\nreally evolve with the rest of Home Assistant and the general expectations of\nour community. It was time for a change!\nOver the last few months, we have worked with the community to revise and\nimprove the scale. Involving not just our community developers but also\ndocumentation writers, user experience designers, and anyone interested\nin the community.\nAs a result, the new Integration Quality Scale is not just focused on the code\nbut even more on the overall user experience. It is now a more holistic view\nof the integration, and we hope it will help everyone make better decisions\nabout what to use in their homes.\n\nWe now have a total of 4 scaled tiers:\n\n🥉 Bronze:\nThe new minimum set of requirements we’ve set for new integrations.\n🥈 Silver:\nEnsuring reliability and robustness of integrations.\n🥇 Gold:\nEnsuring a gold standard user experience, including documentation.\n🏆 Platinum:\nThe epitome of quality, supreme code quality, and optimal performance.\n\nWe also have four additional (non-scaled) special tiers:\n\n❓ No score:\nFor integrations that are not yet scored against the new scale.\n🏠 Internal\nFor integrations Home Assistant itself uses, like the automation engine.\n💾 Legacy\nFor older integrations that can’t be set up through the UI.\n📦 Custom\nFor custom integrations, as we can’t score those.\n\nYou can read all about these tiers, what they have been designed for, and a\nsummary of their characteristics on our dedicated\nIntegration Quality Scale page.\nWe sincerely hope this new scale will not just help our users, but also our\ncommunity developers to understand what is expected by providing a clear path\nto improving their integrations. To help with that, we have now\nextensively documented every rule and requirement for each tier in our\ndeveloper documentation.\nIntegrations\nThanks to our community for keeping pace with the new integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more]\nand improvements to existing ones! You’re all awesome. 🥰\nNew integrations\nWe welcome the following new integrations in this release:\n\nAcaia, added by @zweckj\nAdds support for Acaia coffee scales to Home Assistant.\nMusic Assistant, added by @jozefKruszynski\nThe integration for Music Assistant is making\nits way into Home Assistant! 🎉\nNASweb, added by @nasWebio\nBrings in support for the NASweb automation system to Home Assistant.\nNord Pool, added by @gjohansson-ST\nPulls in latest energy prices from the Nord Pool energy market as sensors.\nSky Remote, added by @dunnmj\nControl your Sky box using automations or from your Home Assistant\ndashboards.\n\nNoteworthy improvements to existing integrations\nIt is not just new integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.

Additionally, a tilt position sensor for\nPTZ cameras has been added. Thanks!\n@fwestenberg updated the Stookwijzer integration, with some new sensors,\nright on time for the winter season. Nice!\nThe Habitica integration now provides actions for quest handling, scoring\nhabits, and rewards. It also adds calendars for your to-do and daily reminders.\nNice, @tr4nt0r!\nThe eQ-3 Bluetooth Smart integration now provides several helpful switches\nand sensors (like away mode, boost, battery). Thanks, @EuleMitKeule!\n@YogevBokobza added Switcher Lights support to the Switcher integration.\nThanks!\n\nOther noteworthy changes\nThere are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other\nnoteworthy changes this release:\n\n@jpbede added a download snapshot button to the camera entity information\ndialog. Super nice! Thanks!\nThe UI now displays durations using a timer format (like 03:26:00) in natural\nlanguage (3h 26min). Thanks @piitaya!\nSupport for new units of measurement has been added:\n\nUnits for area sizes (and conversions between metric and US).\nThanks @mikey0000!\n@jschlyter has added support for MW, GW, TW, GWh, and TWh. Nice!\nµV has been added as a unit of electric potential. Thanks @tr4nt0r!\nLastly, mL/s has been added as a unit of volume flow rate. Thanks @zweckj!\n\n\nIf you are editing an automation using YAML via our UI and you make a mistake…\nyou will now actually see the parsing error message in the UI. This is really\nhelpful! Thanks, @karwosts!\n\nTranslations for units of measurement\nOver the last few years, we have been working hard to make every little\nbit of Home Assistant accessible for everyone by providing translations\nfor every part of the system. 🌐\nHowever, we still have some edge cases, where we are not able to provide\ntranslations for everything. One of those edge cases is the units of\nmeasurement. 📏\nAlthough units do not need translation (like °C or kWh) in most cases, many\nsensors in a home might use specific and non-standardized units. For example,\na sensor that measures the number of “people” in a home or one that tells you\nhow many “movies” are in your collection.\nSo, suppose you now have a sensor with a custom measurement unit, like the\namount of “movies” in your collection. In that case, integrations can now\nprovide translations for those units. 🎉\nSeveral integrations have already added translations for their units, including\nJellyfin, Lyrion Music Server, Transmission, Pi-hole, QBitTorrent,\nNextDNS, Mastodon, and Mealie!\nWe’ve upgraded to Python 3.13\n\nThis release comes packaged with Python 3.13!  🐍\nWondering what that means? Python is the programming language that powers Home\nAssistant behind the scenes.\nWhy does it matter? Every new Python release brings improvements that we can\ntap into—better performance, fewer bugs, and a smoother developer experience\nfor our contributors. Plus, Python 3.13 offers a speed boost to Home Assistant\noverall—what’s not to love? 🚀\nRunning Home Assistant OS or using the Home Assistant Container? No sweat—we’ve\ngot you covered. The upgrade to Python 3.13 is handled automatically. Just\nupdate Home Assistant as usual, and you’re good to go.\nEasy, right? 😎\nPatch releases\nWe will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.12 in December.\nThese patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch\nrelease every Friday.\n2024.12.1 - December 6\n\nBump elmax-api to 0.0.6.3 (@albertogeniola - #131876)\nFix deprecated call to mimetypes.guess_type in CachingStaticResource (@bdraco - #132299)\nBump tesla-fleet-api to 0.8.5 (@Bre77 - #132339)\nAdd missing UnitOfPower to sensor (@robinostlund - #132352)\nRemoves references to croniter from utility_meter (@dgomes - #132364)\nBump upb-lib to 0.5.9 (@gwww - #132411)\nBump pydeako to 0.6.0 (@Balake - #132432)\nBump aiohttp to 3.11.10 (@bdraco - #132441)\nBump aioesphomeapi to 28.0.0 (@bdraco - #132447)\nUpdate exception handling for python3.13 for getpass.getuser() (@allenporter - #132449)\nBump hass-nabucasa from 0.85.0 to 0.86.0 (@ludeeus - #132456)\nFix nordpool dont have previous or next price (@gjohansson-ST - #132457)\nBump deebot-client to 9.2.0 (@edenhaus - #132467)\nPoint to the Ecovacs issue in the library for unspoorted devices (@edenhaus - #132470)\nBump tplink python-kasa dependency to 0.8.1 (@sdb9696 - #132472)\nBump samsungtvws to 2.7.2 (@epenet - #132474)\nUpdate frontend to 20241127.5 (@bramkragten - #132475)\nUpdate frontend to 20241127.6 (@bramkragten - #132494)\nFix google tasks due date timezone handling (@allenporter - #132498)\n\n2024.12.2 - December 10\n\nEnable additional entities on myUplink model SMO20 (@astrandb - #131688)\nBump pydrawise to 2024.12.0 (@dknowles2 - #132015)\nFix API change for AC not supporting floats in SwitchBot Cloud (@SeraphicRav - #132231)\nUpdate pyrisco to 0.6.5 (@agmckaybro - #132493)\nFix PyTado dependency (@erwindouna - #132510)\nBump pycups to 2.0.4 (@bdraco - #132514)\nUpdate debugpy to 1.8.8 (@frenck - #132519)\nbump total_connect_client to 2023.12 (@austinmroczek - #132531)\nBump aiounifi to v81 to fix partitioned cookies on python 3.13 (@Kane610 - #132540)\nUpdate twentemilieu to 2.2.0 (@frenck - #132554)\nBump yalexs-ble to 2.5.2 (@bdraco - #132560)\nBump plugwise to v1.6.1 (@bouwew - #131950)\nBump plugwise to v1.6.2 and adapt (@bouwew - #132608)\nFix config flow in Husqvarna Automower (@Thomas55555 - #132615)\nBump ZHA dependencies (@puddly - #132630)\nBump plugwise to v1.6.3 (@bouwew - #132673)\nBump yt-dlp to 2024.12.06 (@joostlek - #132684)\nRevert “Bump pyezviz to 0.2.2.3” (@srescio - #132715)\nBump intents to 2024.12.9 (@synesthesiam - #132726)\nUpdate frontend to 20241127.7 (@bramkragten - #132729)\nBump reolink-aio to 0.11.5 (@starkillerOG - #132757)\nCatch Hydrawise authorization errors in the correct place (@dknowles2 - #132727)\nPass an application identifier to the Hydrawise API (@dknowles2 - #132779)\nBump deebot-client to 9.3.0 (@edenhaus - #132834)\nBump aioacaia to 0.1.11 (@zweckj - #132838)\n\n2024.12.3 - December 13\n\nBump python-linkplay to v0.1.1 (@silamon - #132091)\nBump pydaikin to 2.13.8 (@weltall - #132759)\nFix pipeline conversation language (@synesthesiam - #132896)\nfix AndroidTV logging when disconnected (@chemelli74 - #132919)\nGuard Vodafone Station updates against bad data (@chemelli74 - #132921)\nBump led-ble to 1.1.1 (@bdraco - #132977)\nChange warning to debug for VAD timeout (@synesthesiam - #132987)\nFix LaMetric config flow for cloud import path (@frenck - #133039)\nUpdate frontend to 20241127.8 (@bramkragten - #133066)\nBump pysuezV2 to 1.3.5 (@jb101010-2 - #133076)\nBugfix to use evohome’s new hostname (@zxdavb - #133085)\nBump py-aosmith to 1.0.12 (@bdr99 - #133100)\nBump deebot-client to 9.4.0 (@edenhaus - #133114)\nBump aiowithings to 3.1.4 (@joostlek - #133117)\n\n2024.12.4 - December 17\n\nSimplify recorder RecorderRunsManager (@emontnemery - #131785)\nFix fibaro climate hvac mode (@rappenze - #132508)\nBump yt-dlp to 2024.12.13 (@joostlek - #133129)\nFix strptime in python_script (@gjohansson-ST - #133159)\nBump yalexs-ble to 2.5.4 (@bdraco - #133172)\nBump starlink-grpc-core to 1.2.1 to fix missing ping (@MrConorAE - #133183)\nBump aiolifx to 1.1.2 and add new HomeKit product prefixes (@Djelibeybi - #133191)\nRevert “Simplify recorder RecorderRunsManager” (@emontnemery - #133201)\nRevert “Improve recorder history queries (#131702)” (@emontnemery - #133203)\nBump incomfort-client to v0.6.4 (@jbouwh - #133205)\nBump yalexs-ble to 2.5.5 (@bdraco - #133229)\nSet code_arm_required to False for homekit_controller (@bdraco - #133284)\nAllow load_verify_locations with only cadata passed (@mib1185 - #133299)\nBump imgw-pib to version 1.0.7 (@bieniu - #133364)\nFix fan setpoints for flexit_bacnet (@lellky - #133388)\nBump holidays to 0.63 (@gjohansson-ST - #133391)\n\n2024.12.5 - December 20\n\nBump nice-go to 1.0.0 (@IceBotYT - #133185)\nAdd support for Nice G.O.

Unfortunately, sometimes,\nit is inevitable.\nWe always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as\npossible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:\n\n  \n    \n      Brother Printer\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThe unit of measurement for pages changed from p to pages.\nThis could potentially break use cases if it was used in templates where a state\nwith a unit is used, such as states('sensor.pages', with_unit=True).\n(@bieniu - #131275) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Ecovacs\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nEcovacs devices not recognized by the library will no longer use the fallback\nvacuum. Instead, the device will not be added to Home Assistant,\nand a warning log will created.\n(@edenhaus - #131525) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Glances\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThe previously deprecated Glances v2 API has been removed. Upgrade to v3 or\nhigher to continue using the integration.\n(@gjohansson-ST - #131427) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      History Stats\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nAfter this change, history_stats in time or ratio mode will only count\ndefinitively known time-based recorded data.\nPrior to this change, if the start of the time window was earlier than the\noldest datapoint in the recorder, history_stats would count time using the\nassumption that an entity was in the first state it found since the beginning\nof time. This could lead to wild overcalculations when a switch was turned on\nafter a long period of inactivity, and history_stats would assume it had\nalways been on and calculate a huge value based on that.\n(@karwosts - #126271) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Jewish Calendar\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nTo support Rosh Chodesh this creates a breaking change as the holiday sensor\nwill return “Chanukah, Rosh Chodesh” when both of those days fall on the same\ndate. If you have an automation expecting the “Chanukah” value, you must update\nit.\n(@tsvi - #130456) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Plugwise\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nFor the Plugwise Adam, all device-based climate entities will be replaced by new zone-based climate entities, which will most likely have different entity names.\nThis change aligns with the Plugwise App’s representation of climate entities as zones (as discovered in Issue #130597).\n(@bouwew - #131659) (documentation)\n \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      QNAP\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThe QNAP sensors will no longer have the following extra state attributes:\n\nmemory_free\nmemory_percent_used\nmemory_size\nmemory_used\nnetwork_err\nnetwork_link_status\nnetwork_max_speed\nnetwork_rx\nnetwork_tx\nstatus\nsystem_temp\nuptime\nvolume_percentage_used\nvolume_size_free\nvolume_size_total\nvolume_size_used\n\nThese extra state attributes were deprecated in Home Assistant 2024.6 and have\nnow been removed. If you are using this in your automation or script, use\nthe separate available sensors instead.\n(@jbouwh - #130310) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Spotify\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThe Spotify audio feature sensors have been removed since Spotify\nremoved access for them, starting 27 November.\nAdditionally, featured and category playlists have been removed from\nthe Spotify media browser since Spotify deprecated the API,\nstarting on 27 November.\n(@joostlek - #131754 #131758) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Statistics\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nPreviously the attributes of the entity states of the Statistics integration were only provided when they had a non None value.\nThis has now changed so the attributes are always provided even with None\nvalues. You might need to modify your automations or scripts depending on\nwhether these attributes are present or not.\n(@gjohansson-ST - #129353) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Stookwijzer\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThe Stookwijzer sensor has migrated to the new API provided by Atlas\nLeefomgeving. As a result, the reported states are slightly different.\nOld versus new:\n\nBlue (blauw) -> Yellow (code_yellow)\nOrange (oranje) -> Orange (code_orange)\nRed (rood) -> Red (code_red)\n\nIf you use the Stookwijzer sensor in your automations or scripts, you might\nneed to adjust those for this change.\n(@frenck - #131567) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Templates\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThe this template variable which is available in some templatable helpers was\npreviously based on the new state instead of the current state.\nThe change affects the following integrations, if templates use the this\nvariable. The user might have to update their templates to reflect the above\nchange using the value variable instead, which holds the new value.\n\ncommand_line\nrest\nscrape\nsnmp\nsql\n\n(@gjohansson-ST - #130135)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Z-Wave\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nWith this release, you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance. You\nmust use zwave-js-server 1.39.0 or greater (schema 39).\n\nIf you use the Z-Wave JS add-on, you need at least version 0.9.0.\nIf you use the Z-Wave JS UI add-on, you need at least version 3.17.0.\nIf you use the Z-Wave JS UI Docker container, you need at least version 9.26.0.\nIf you run your own Docker container or some other installation method, you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance to at least 1.39.0.\n\n(@MindFreeze - #129482) (documentation)\n\n  \n\nIf you are a custom integration developer and want to learn about changes and\nnew features available for your integration: Be sure to follow our\ndeveloper blog. The following are the most notable for this release:\n\nCamera API changes\nIntegration quality scale\nNew options flow properties\nTranslating units of measurement\nUtility function homeassistant.util.dt.utc_to_timestamp is deprecated\n\nAll changes\nOf course, there is a lot more in this release.

Every <a href=\"/blog/2020/08/18/the-month-of-what-the-heck/\">two</a> <a href=\"/blog/2022/09/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/\">years</a>, we take the time to\npause, listen, and dive deep into the little things that maybe you go\n<em>“What the heck?!”</em> about Home Assistant.</p>\n<p>We’ve been <a href=\"https://analytics.home-assistant.io/\">growing really hard for years now</a> with over a million\nHome Assistant-powered smart homes out there, and, as of this year, we are also\n<a href=\"/blog/2024/11/18/event-wrapup-github-universe-24/#we-are-number-1\">the #1 open source project on GitHub</a>!</p>\n<p>A lot has happened since <a href=\"/blog/2022/09/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/\">the last edition two years ago</a>. Lots of effort went\ninto making a <a href=\"/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/\">voice-controlled Home Assistant</a> a reality. We have implemented\n<a href=\"/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#sections-dashboard-no-longer-experimental\">new dashboards and cards</a> (with drag-and-drop!),\n<a href=\"/blog/2024/04/03/release-20244/#three-new-ways-to-organize\">added organization capabilities</a> with labels and categories, and so <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#dipping-our-toes-in-the-world-of-ai-using-llms\">much</a>\n<a href=\"/blog/2023/11/01/release-202311/#there-is-a-lot-to-do\">more</a>! But did everything turn out the way it should? Did we miss things?\nOr, worse, did something start to annoy you?</p>\n<p>That is what this month is about! This year, we are kicking it off in the month\nof <strong>December</strong> as a nice closing activity for this year, and we can’t wait to\nhear from 👉 <strong>YOU</strong> 👈!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Lowering the barrier for sharing WTH?! moments</h3>\n<p>We realize reporting bugs on our <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/new/choose\">GitHub</a> might be a steep hill and, for some,\nmaybe even a bit scary. You need a GitHub account to report an issue following\nissue templates and forms, and the report itself needs to be written in a way\nthat a developer can work with. Above all, we use our issue tracker to track\nactual issues and bugs, not small feature requests or annoyances.</p>\n<p>While this is a common and reasonable process to collect, track, and process\nbugs, our issue tracking-process might not be the ideal way to learn about your\n<em>“What the heck?!”</em> moments, small tweaks, and improvements that can make us\nall enjoy Home Assistant even more.</p>\n<p>Today, we have opened up a <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/c/month-of-what-the-heck/61\">Community Forum category</a> as a safe, lower-barrier\nplace to talk about your Home Assistant “What the heck?!” moments.\nMore importantly: discuss and vote on topics your fellow home automators have\nbrought up.</p>\n<h2>What are we looking for?</h2>\n<p>Just as with previous editions, I sent out a related question on my socials\nearlier this week:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>🎅 𝘚𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘢 𝘮𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 𝘣𝘦 𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨… If you could ask for one small Home Assistant\nimprovement this holiday season, what would it be?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The answers to this question pretty much capture the goal behind this month:\nFinding those nice quality-of-life features and little annoyances, highlighting\ninconsistencies, suggestions for things that could be streamlined more, and even\nbig-ticket items. All of those things would make Home Assistant even more\nawesome for everyone.</p>\n<p>I’ve received many responses on these social media posts on <a href=\"https://x.com/Frenck/status/1861823068735181154\">X</a>, <a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@frenck/113556074335097996\">Mastodon</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ofidofdlypuxb2dlfdmbh3a3/post/3lbx2w2kh5a2p\">Bluesky</a>. Most of the responses there are <strong>exactly</strong> what we are looking\nfor this month. I’ve picked a few from these platforms to show you what I mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“<em>Makes exposing entities to HomeKit the same as to Alexa &amp; Google</em>” (<a href=\"https://x.com/peterjvandoorn/status/1861898354038292579\">Peter Hardy-vanDoorn</a>)</li>\n<li><em>“Polygon zones would be so very helpful instead of just the base circle”</em> (<a href=\"https://x.com/KrispKiwi/status/1861825026825265406\">KrispKiwi</a>)</li>\n<li>“<em>Edit a scene without activating it. I can only edit my sleep scene after everyone goes to sleep or in YAML.”</em> (<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/codebuild21.bsky.social/post/3lbx72g4l6s2n\">codebuild21</a>)</li>\n<li><em>“The possibility of catching errors in automations and being able to take actions when they occur 🙂”</em> (<a href=\"https://x.com/sermayoral/status/1862109088139583917\">Sergio Mayoral</a>)</li>\n<li><em>“Not Fancy! Better backup management, especially pruning options!”</em> (<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/aaposutry.bsky.social/post/3lby3xqhzzk2w\">Alex Alami</a>)</li>\n<li><em>“Persist my prefered dashboard across my different devices/browsers.”</em> (<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/chayotejarocho.space/post/3lbx7yorfms2c\">Carlos Sánchez López</a>)</li>\n<li><em>“Home Assistant voice hardware!”</em> (<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/paulusschoutsen.nl/post/3lbx32dabes2s\">Paulus Schoutsen</a>) 😆</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are all great topics for the month of “What the heck?!”, I hope they inspire you for more topics to share 💖.</p>\n<h2>Roadmap</h2>\n<p>As you might be aware, we also create and publish a bigger, high level, roadmap\nfor the greater direction of Home Assistant.

    "sanitized": "TL;DR: For all of December 🎄, we are opening up to share any issue, idea,\nsuggestion, or annoyance you have with Home Assistant\non our community forums!\nWelcome to the month of “What the heck?!”: Third edition\nIt’s back! 🎉 We are thrilled to announce the third edition of the month\nof “What the heck?!” (WTH for short). Every two years, we take the time to\npause, listen, and dive deep into the little things that maybe you go\n“What the heck?!” about Home Assistant.\nWe’ve been growing really hard for years now with over a million\nHome Assistant-powered smart homes out there, and, as of this year, we are also\nthe #1 open source project on GitHub!\nA lot has happened since the last edition two years ago. Lots of effort went\ninto making a voice-controlled Home Assistant a reality. We have implemented\nnew dashboards and cards (with drag-and-drop!),\nadded organization capabilities with labels and categories, and so much\nmore! But did everything turn out the way it should? Did we miss things?\nOr, worse, did something start to annoy you?\nThat is what this month is about! This year, we are kicking it off in the month\nof December as a nice closing activity for this year, and we can’t wait to\nhear from 👉 YOU 👈!\n\nLowering the barrier for sharing WTH?! moments\nWe realize reporting bugs on our GitHub might be a steep hill and, for some,\nmaybe even a bit scary. You need a GitHub account to report an issue following\nissue templates and forms, and the report itself needs to be written in a way\nthat a developer can work with. Above all, we use our issue tracker to track\nactual issues and bugs, not small feature requests or annoyances.\nWhile this is a common and reasonable process to collect, track, and process\nbugs, our issue tracking-process might not be the ideal way to learn about your\n“What the heck?!” moments, small tweaks, and improvements that can make us\nall enjoy Home Assistant even more.\nToday, we have opened up a Community Forum category as a safe, lower-barrier\nplace to talk about your Home Assistant “What the heck?!” moments.\nMore importantly: discuss and vote on topics your fellow home automators have\nbrought up.\nWhat are we looking for?\nJust as with previous editions, I sent out a related question on my socials\nearlier this week:\n\n🎅 𝘚𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘢 𝘮𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 𝘣𝘦 𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨… If you could ask for one small Home Assistant\nimprovement this holiday season, what would it be?\n\nThe answers to this question pretty much capture the goal behind this month:\nFinding those nice quality-of-life features and little annoyances, highlighting\ninconsistencies, suggestions for things that could be streamlined more, and even\nbig-ticket items. All of those things would make Home Assistant even more\nawesome for everyone.\nI’ve received many responses on these social media posts on X, Mastodon,\nand Bluesky. Most of the responses there are exactly what we are looking\nfor this month. I’ve picked a few from these platforms to show you what I mean:\n\n“Makes exposing entities to HomeKit the same as to Alexa & Google” (Peter Hardy-vanDoorn)\n“Polygon zones would be so very helpful instead of just the base circle” (KrispKiwi)\n“Edit a scene without activating it. I can only edit my sleep scene after everyone goes to sleep or in YAML.” (codebuild21)\n“The possibility of catching errors in automations and being able to take actions when they occur 🙂” (Sergio Mayoral)\n“Not Fancy! Better backup management, especially pruning options!” (Alex Alami)\n“Persist my prefered dashboard across my different devices/browsers.” (Carlos Sánchez López)\n“Home Assistant voice hardware!” (Paulus Schoutsen) 😆\n\nThese are all great topics for the month of “What the heck?!”, I hope they inspire you for more topics to share 💖.\nRoadmap\nAs you might be aware, we also create and publish a bigger, high level, roadmap\nfor the greater direction of Home Assistant. A few weeks back, Madelena\nand JLo shared the 2024 Year-end update of our roadmap.\nThis year’s month of “What the heck?!” is thus different in this regard, as in\nprevious editions we didn’t have any roadmap in place. For this year’s WTH,\nthe product team will also be watching for items that will help shape and\nprioritize our roadmap for the near future.\nAs a matter of fact, many items on this year’s roadmap that we’ve worked on\nhave their origins or have been shaped by topics from the previous WTH from\n2022. For example, the ability to organize automations and the ability to\ndrag-and-drop cards on your dashboards.\nWhy December?\nIn the previous editions, we had this month in October; this year, we decided to\nmove it to December. We figured, the holiday season is perfect for this event. 🎄\nMany of us have a bit more time on our hands during the holidays, whether that’s\ntinkering with automations, exploring our new dashboards, contributing to our\nproject, or simply enjoying engaging our active and vibrant community.\nStart sharing your WTH!\n👆That title says it all really. Start sharing your “What the heck?!”\nmoment, browse through all the WTH moments others brought up, and vote for the\nones you feel the same about.\nWe are excited about this month and looking forward to everything brought up!\nJoin us on the forums!, or read the FAQ below.\n\n\nSo, when does Home Assistant trigger this moment for you?\n\nFAQ\n\n\n“Great! I have multiple things! Should I put all my stuff in a single\ntopic?!”\nNo, please create multiple, smaller topics. There is no limitation\non how many forum topics one can create for WTH. Each topic can be voted on,\npicked up, and maybe even resolved. Also, having multiple things stacked in\na single forum topic makes resolving, discussing, and voting on them hard.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Is everything reported going to be fixed/addressed?”\nSorry, but the answer here is no; there is no guarantee that it will\nhappen.

We also won the Wonderfully Welcoming award for being the 2nd most active project for <em>new</em> contributors. This is really just scratching the surface of the week we spent together in San Francisco, and I (<a href=\"https://github.com/missyquarry\">Missy Quarry</a>, your Community &amp; Social Media Manager) would like to share the highlights with everyone who couldn’t make it this year.</p>\n<h3>Table of contents</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#community-comes-together\">Community comes together</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#we-are-number-1\">We are number 1!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#open-source---%EF%B8%8F-of-the-show\">Open Source - ⭐️ of the show</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#connecting-with-the-community\">Connecting with the community</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Community comes together</h2>\n<p>What started as a simple request to attend the event tumbled into not only being a part of the Day 2 Keynote of GitHub Universe ❗❗ but being offered a venue at GitHub HQ for a community meetup. It picked up from there - interviews, speaking on panels, and after-parties - this 2-day event spun into a 7-day trip to San Francisco. Not only was this my first event as a part of an open source project, but it was also my first time meeting <a href=\"https://github.com/balloob\">Paulus</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/frenck\">Frenck</a> in person. Paulus is taller than I expected 😅 and Frenck has legs! 😱</p>\n<p>While there is a lot of good news for us that came out of GitHub Universe (and I <em>will</em> get to that), I would be a poor community manager if I didn’t start this out with the first in-person meetup I coordinated for Home Assistant. 😌</p>\n<p>I knew immediately that I needed custom swag for the event, and got to work with our Graphic Artist, Clelia.

    "sanitized": "In case you missed it, we had a pretty huge presence at this year’s GitHub Universe, their global annual developer conference. 2024 was the culmination of many years of our community growing, and there were some really big moments—our community meetup in San Francisco, awards, rising in GitHub’s rankings, and being a part of the event’s Day 2 keynote.\nAfter a few years of being in 2nd place, we are now the #1 open source project on GitHub with over 21,000 contributors helping build Home Assistant.

Our plan is categorized into the following product areas:</p>\n<h3>Automations</h3>\n<h4>In good shape: Make automations easier to organize</h4>\n<p>For a long time, the ability to organize automation was at the top of our feature requests. Therefore, organizing automations was our first focus on the automation product area.</p>\n<p>We gave users the ability to categorize automations, which makes the process of managing, editing, debugging, and searching automations much simpler. The categories are up to the users to define. For instance, I personally created categories per functionality such as “Smart Heating” or “Smart Cleaning”, and I particularly like my “Tests” categories where I keep all the automations that are currently being tested in my home.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-04/filter-panel.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Automations settings with filter panel\" /></p>\n<p>On top of categories, users can now attach labels to automations, just like any other entity found in Home Assistant. Labels can be used to filter the automation list further, but what I am most interested in is the automation capabilities of the labels themselves. I saw some great ideas in the community, one of them that struck me was the idea to label some automation as “Not Guest Friendly” and deactivate them when a guest mode was activated. It’s nice to see labels as a tool to automate everything, even your automations themselves. 😀</p>\n<p>All in all, Home Assistant truly made automations easier to organize in the past 6 months. We could still work on that, no opportunity is ever really done, but for the time being, we are considering this one done so that we can focus on bigger problems.</p>\n<h4>Newly in progress: Make automations easier to create</h4>\n<p>Automations are one of the cornerstones of Home Assistant, but it’s not an easy task to create them, especially if you are just starting out. There are a dozen things to know before you start and a dozen things to learn along the way.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-01/add-action-search.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new add action dialog utilizing the search function to find whatever you need.\">\n<p>Last year we redesigned our action picker and replaced a single option with an obscure name, <strong>“Call Service”</strong>, with hundreds of neatly categorized entries that we called <strong>“Actions”</strong>. This improved the automation creation process by quite a margin.</p>\n<p>Today, the automation editor feels like it has progressed at two different speeds; our actions are easy to use, but our triggers and conditions are not. So we have begun bringing the same level of convenience that we previously brought to actions to our beloved triggers and conditions.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to make our automation editor more approachable without losing what makes us unique: Its capabilities.</p>\n<h4>Later priority: Make blueprints easier to use</h4>\n<p>Blueprints are amazing, they represent what makes the Home Assistant community truly great: Sharing what you learned with others.</p>\n<p>We are aware that using (and sharing) blueprints is not the most straightforward process today. For now, this is the next opportunity we want to tackle inside the automation stream.</p>\n<h3>Dashboards</h3>\n<h4>In good shape: Make customization of dashboards easy and intuitive</h4>\n<p>With the stable release of the new Sections view layout in Home Assistant <a href=\"/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/\">2024.11</a>, our work on making customization of dashboards easier is now in good shape! The learning curve for creating nice dashboards has been vastly reduced, and we are seeing more and more people being interested in and being able to create high-quality dashboards that are usable for everyone in the household.</p>\n<p class='img no-shadow'><img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11/dashboard-conversion.png\"/>Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections</p>\n<p>Work will continue with the dashboard working group. The group is currently looking into standardizing the appearance of our default cards. <strong>Please <a href=\"/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/#process-how-can-we-work-together\">reach out to us</a> if you are a frontend developer</strong> who would like to contribute and be part of the journey!</p>\n<h4>Newly in progress: Make default dashboards more useful and relevant</h4>\n<p>Now that we’ve made customization of dashboards easier than ever, what’s next? We understand that it can be intimidating for users when they are faced with a blank slate. Some may be full of ideas on how they would like to fill their dashboards up, but some would prefer if Home Assistant came with something useful out-of-the-box. Therefore, we are now looking into making dashboards easier, even if you don’t know how to create one.</p>\n<p class='img'><img alt=\"Case studies of many dashboards of our users\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11-roadmap-2024h2/dashboard-casestudies.png\"/>Case studies of many dashboards of our users</p>\n<p>Over the past year, we have looked into dozens of case studies - dashboards created by many of you, from the most popular to the most pragmatic - and began to notice patterns in how our users organize their dashboards. Home Assistant is unique compared to other smart home platforms in that our dashboards are not just about controlling devices. After all, the perfect app is no app, as in, opening an app to control your light bulb is less convenient than simply flicking a light switch, or better yet, just automating it.</p>\n<p>What we see our users have built instead are dashboards that help them keep track of information for their daily lives at a glance, and keep a birds-eye view of everything that is going on around their homes. For example, while you can automate Home Assistant to notify you when energy usage is too high, or you can ask Assist the current power usage, our dashboards shine at data visualization and its ability to tell you lots of information you need by just glancing at it.</p>\n<p>Currently, our default dashboard simply dumps every single entity that a home has onto one page, making it wildly unmanageable as the smart home grows. While it can automatically group entities by areas, we have learned that areas are not the only way users look at their dashboard information. What we saw instead are dashboards that are specialized and focused on the functions of a home, such as energy usage, security and safety, and network status, on complex objects, such as a car and a 3D printer, or on information unrelated to the home itself, such as weather, neighborhood information, or even rocket launches. While we can simply show every entity by domain, we know we can make these function-focused dashboards much more useful by exposing insights by curating and juxtaposing information.</p>\n<h4>Next priority: Improve privacy in user, guest, and public access</h4>\n<p>The inability to fine-tune access to Home Assistant by guests or other members of the family has been a pain point requested by many of our users. We want to investigate ways to mitigate this while improving the privacy of the household. Our research on what privacy means to users will hopefully bring more clarity to this before we start working on it.</p>\n<h3>Voice Assistants</h3>\n<h4>In good shape: Improve Assist capabilities out of the box</h4>\n<p>Assist, our private voice assistant, received a lot of love over the last 6 months. Our first focus was to improve its capabilities out of the box, without needing to tinker with it. We added a lot of features that were heavily requested by the community, features that bring us one step closer to feature parity with our non-private competitors.</p>\n<p>We brought area awareness, which allows you to target devices in the same area without mentioning the area (like “Close the curtains” or “Turn off the lights”). We brought floor support, which allows you to target devices across areas on the same floor; very useful for homes with an open floor design (for example “Turn on all lights on the first floor”).</p>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"v3mNdTsX4J0\" videotitle=\"Voice timers with countdown text and loading bar\"></lite-youtube>Timers running on an S3 Box, with countdown text and a loading bar!</p>\n<p>We implemented timers, allowing any voice assistant device to “ring” when a timer ends, including supporting the creation of multiple timers. You can also pause and resume them and add or remove time from them. You can combine commands with timers by giving a delayed command, allowing you to perform an action after a specific amount of time (like “Turn off the TV in 30 minutes)”.</p>\n<p>We also brought the ability to control media via voice. Pausing or resuming them, controlling the volume, and going to the next track. This, combined with the area awareness capability mentioned above made for some really interesting short commands that work in a room with a TV playing or music streaming, such as “Pause”, “Resume” and “Next”.</p>\n<p>Finally, our on-device wake word engine called microWakeWord became much faster and much better at recognizing wake words. This is the result of using real voice data in the training process to fine-tune the models. With <a href=\"https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/\">Wake Word Collective</a>, you can now contribute by lending your voice to improve our community-driven, privacy-focused voice assistant! You can read more about it in <a href=\"/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/\">this blog post</a>.</p>\n<h4>In progress: Make Assist easier to start with</h4>\n<p>So Assist is more capable, but what about getting started with Voice?</p>\n<p>Voice is hard because it is a combination of great software and great hardware. Up until recently, we primarily focused on making the software experience great and relied on readily available hardware to power our voice assistants.</p>\n<p class='img'><img alt=\"A teaser of our voice hardware\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11-roadmap-2024h2/voice-hardware-teaser.jpg\"/>A teaser of our voice hardware</p>\n<p>However, this is changing - over the past 6 months, we have built our own hardware! It will be the first voice assistant hardware built from the ground up to work with Home Assistant, fully open source (firmware and hardware), and it is going to be released <em>very soon</em>. It is truly the missing hardware piece to a more approachable voice experience in Home Assistant, and we cannot wait to see what you will build with it.</p>\n<h4>Later priority: Make Assist more conversational</h4>\n<p>The more functionality we add to Assist, the more we reach its transactional limitations. Indeed, today, an interaction is one way, from a user (issuing a command) to Assist (acting on that command). We would like to improve this, allowing more conversational interactions with Assist.</p>\n<p>In the future, Assist will be able to ask for clarifications before fulfilling a command, such as requesting the duration of a timer if it was not part of the original command or asking for confirmation before processing critical actions, such as unlocking all doors. On top of that, we would like to allow the conversation to start from Assist, and not from the user, such as greeting someone when they enter a room.\nThis pairs very well with LLM-based conversation agents due to their ability to retain context, but we will make sure these types of complex interactions are also possible with our default conversation agent.</p>\n<h3>Research</h3>\n<h4>In good shape: Build local LLM infrastructure</h4>\n<p>In the past six months, we’ve introduced support for LLM local tools and <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#control-home-assistant-using-ai-with-ollama\">Ollama</a>, pushing our efforts to make AI more accessible and private for experimentation within Home Assistant. We’ve also dedicated significant effort to creating realistic benchmarks, focusing on natural, conversational use cases rather than edge cases. This approach lets us better understand performance and user experience in day-to-day interactions.</p>\n<p>Our latest benchmark for local language models (LLMs) can be explored <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports\">here</a>, showcasing how models like qwen2.5 perform in realistic settings. With these insights, we’re continuing to refine LLM integrations and to ensure that LLMs can be depended upon for common use cases at home.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-06-voice-chapter-7/voice-script.png' alt=\"Exposing voice scripts to Assist in Home Assistant Voice settings\" class='no-shadow'>\n<p>You can now expand LLM capabilities by <a href=\"/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#expand-an-llm-using-your-scripts\">allowing them access to your scripts</a>. This feature lets you precisely control what the LLM does in specific situations, while still benefiting from the flexibility and natural language processing that AIs excel at.</p>\n<h4>In progress: Investigate on privacy</h4>\n<p>Since our last roadmap update, we have expanded the product and design team working on the Home Assistant project, and we have hired our first ever dedicated user researcher!</p>\n<p>While we are ramping up our user research pipeline, we have started working on investigating what privacy means to our users. Of the three Open Home values, privacy, choice, and sustainability, while we have a pretty solid understanding of choice and some understanding of sustainability, the idea of privacy can benefit from more clarity. We have interviewed a handful of users on this topic recently, and we can’t wait to show you what we have found.</p>\n<h2>Home Assistant Cloud</h2>\n<p>Home Assistant Cloud, powered by our commercial partner Nabu Casa brings, to the many, the hard-to-reach features of Home Assistant usually reserved for power users with expensive hardware at home, with no compromise on privacy.</p>\n<p>In recent months, the Nabu Casa team has been hard at work in bringing peace of mind to using Home Assistant. For the cloud backup feature, the Home Assistant team and the Nabu Casa team are now working closely together on a comprehensive revamp of backup integrations, to create an easy one-stop solution to a good backup strategy. We are also working to ensure users have a smooth onboarding for backing up to Home Assistant Cloud, as well as other third-party backup locations.</p>\n<p>The team had to postpone some features in favor of others like <a href=\"/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#low-latency-cameras-using-webrtc\">WebRTC</a>. They had successfully released the infrastructure needed to support WebRTC, both STUN servers for every Home Assistant user and TURN servers for every Home Assistant Cloud subscriber, enhancing real-time communication capabilities within Home Assistant. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is one of the postponed features, but it is still in the Nabu Casa pipeline.</p>\n<h2>Open Protocols</h2>\n<p>We remain committed to supporting open smart home standards, including Z-Wave Zigbee, Matter, and Thread, aligning with our Open Home mission to offer choice, privacy, and sustainability through locally controlled, cloud-independent devices.</p>\n<p>In the past six months, we have made significant steps towards certifications, ensuring our open standards implementations are up to industry standards.</p>\n<h3>Z-Wave</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/blog/2024/09/24/we-are-joining-the-z-wave-alliance-board/\">September</a>, Paulus, the founder of Home Assistant, announced his new role on the Z-Wave Alliance Board of Directors, representing Nabu Casa. Serving on the board will allow Nabu Casa to contribute meaningfully to Z-Wave’s development and ensure that the needs of Home Assistant users and open-source values are represented.</p>\n<p>As interest in Z-Wave devices in our ecosystem continues to grow, this has driven Home Assistant to advance the Z-Wave JS stack and create its own Z-Wave hardware. While we are working on the <a href=\"/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead\">certification of our Z-Wave implementation</a>, our work on building our own Z-Wave antenna has also been progressing smoothly. We base the design of our antenna on the <a href=\"https://github.com/drzwave/ZRAD\">Z-Wave Reference Application Design</a> to create a Z-Wave antenna with the best performance in the market.</p>\n<h3>Matter</h3>\n<p>As one of the first in the industry, in June, we proudly announced that Home Assistant is now based on the <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#matter-turns-13\">latest Matter 1.3 specification</a>. Since then, we continued to update our Matter implementation to improve the reliability and compatibility of Matter devices, and Matter certification should hopefully happen any day now soon!</p>\n<p>We have brought expanded device support and performance improvements to Home Assistant’s Matter integration.

    "sanitized": "TL;DR We are making great progress on our roadmap, and moving forward onto the next priorities on the roadmap. 🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃\nAs we had previously mentioned, the goal of the roadmap is to provide a North Star for all of our product initiatives to follow in a coherent and consistent direction. At the State of the Open Home in April this year, we introduced to our community our first roadmap. We intend to keep our community informed every half year, and this is our first update to our public roadmap.\nWe are happy to report that we have made good progress on the product initiatives on our roadmap so far, thanks to our core maintainers along with the help of the team at Nabu Casa, the commercial partner of the Open Home Foundation. Most of the product initiatives in the 2024 roadmap have matured according to plan, and now the team has begun to focus on the ones that we had planned for next.\n- Madelena & JLo\n\n\nHome Assistant: “A Home-Approved Smart Home”\n\nAutomations\n\nIn good shape: Make automations easier to organize\nNewly in progress: Make automations easier to create\nLater priority: Make blueprints easier to use\n\n\nDashboards\n\nIn good shape: Make customization of dashboards easy and intuitive\nNewly in progress: Make default dashboards more useful and relevant\nNext priority: Improve privacy in user, guest, and public access\n\n\nVoice Assistants\n\nIn good shape: Improve Assist capabilities out of the box\nIn progress: Make Assist easier to start with\nLater priority: Make Assist more conversational\n\n\nResearch\n\nIn good shape: Build local LLM infrastructure\nIn progress: Investigate on privacy\n\n\n\n\nHome Assistant Cloud\nOpen Protocols\n\nZ-Wave\nMatter\nZigbee\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nHome Assistant: “A Home-Approved Smart Home”\nThe theme of the Home Assistant roadmap is to improve the Home Approval Factor of our platform, ensuring the adoption of Home Assistant by other household members within a smart home.\nThis can be done by improving the touchpoints that all members of the household will interact with, such as automations, dashboards, and voice assistants, while maintaining the power and depth of the platform for our power users and admins. Our plan is categorized into the following product areas:\nAutomations\nIn good shape: Make automations easier to organize\nFor a long time, the ability to organize automation was at the top of our feature requests. Therefore, organizing automations was our first focus on the automation product area.\nWe gave users the ability to categorize automations, which makes the process of managing, editing, debugging, and searching automations much simpler. The categories are up to the users to define. For instance, I personally created categories per functionality such as “Smart Heating” or “Smart Cleaning”, and I particularly like my “Tests” categories where I keep all the automations that are currently being tested in my home.\n\nOn top of categories, users can now attach labels to automations, just like any other entity found in Home Assistant. Labels can be used to filter the automation list further, but what I am most interested in is the automation capabilities of the labels themselves. I saw some great ideas in the community, one of them that struck me was the idea to label some automation as “Not Guest Friendly” and deactivate them when a guest mode was activated. It’s nice to see labels as a tool to automate everything, even your automations themselves. 😀\nAll in all, Home Assistant truly made automations easier to organize in the past 6 months. We could still work on that, no opportunity is ever really done, but for the time being, we are considering this one done so that we can focus on bigger problems.\nNewly in progress: Make automations easier to create\nAutomations are one of the cornerstones of Home Assistant, but it’s not an easy task to create them, especially if you are just starting out. There are a dozen things to know before you start and a dozen things to learn along the way.\n\nLast year we redesigned our action picker and replaced a single option with an obscure name, “Call Service”, with hundreds of neatly categorized entries that we called “Actions”. This improved the automation creation process by quite a margin.\nToday, the automation editor feels like it has progressed at two different speeds; our actions are easy to use, but our triggers and conditions are not. So we have begun bringing the same level of convenience that we previously brought to actions to our beloved triggers and conditions.\nOur goal is to make our automation editor more approachable without losing what makes us unique: Its capabilities.\nLater priority: Make blueprints easier to use\nBlueprints are amazing, they represent what makes the Home Assistant community truly great: Sharing what you learned with others.\nWe are aware that using (and sharing) blueprints is not the most straightforward process today. For now, this is the next opportunity we want to tackle inside the automation stream.\nDashboards\nIn good shape: Make customization of dashboards easy and intuitive\nWith the stable release of the new Sections view layout in Home Assistant 2024.11, our work on making customization of dashboards easier is now in good shape! The learning curve for creating nice dashboards has been vastly reduced, and we are seeing more and more people being interested in and being able to create high-quality dashboards that are usable for everyone in the household.\nScreenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections\nWork will continue with the dashboard working group. The group is currently looking into standardizing the appearance of our default cards. Please reach out to us if you are a frontend developer who would like to contribute and be part of the journey!\nNewly in progress: Make default dashboards more useful and relevant\nNow that we’ve made customization of dashboards easier than ever, what’s next? We understand that it can be intimidating for users when they are faced with a blank slate. Some may be full of ideas on how they would like to fill their dashboards up, but some would prefer if Home Assistant came with something useful out-of-the-box. Therefore, we are now looking into making dashboards easier, even if you don’t know how to create one.\nCase studies of many dashboards of our users\nOver the past year, we have looked into dozens of case studies - dashboards created by many of you, from the most popular to the most pragmatic - and began to notice patterns in how our users organize their dashboards. Home Assistant is unique compared to other smart home platforms in that our dashboards are not just about controlling devices. After all, the perfect app is no app, as in, opening an app to control your light bulb is less convenient than simply flicking a light switch, or better yet, just automating it.\nWhat we see our users have built instead are dashboards that help them keep track of information for their daily lives at a glance, and keep a birds-eye view of everything that is going on around their homes. For example, while you can automate Home Assistant to notify you when energy usage is too high, or you can ask Assist the current power usage, our dashboards shine at data visualization and its ability to tell you lots of information you need by just glancing at it.\nCurrently, our default dashboard simply dumps every single entity that a home has onto one page, making it wildly unmanageable as the smart home grows. While it can automatically group entities by areas, we have learned that areas are not the only way users look at their dashboard information. What we saw instead are dashboards that are specialized and focused on the functions of a home, such as energy usage, security and safety, and network status, on complex objects, such as a car and a 3D printer, or on information unrelated to the home itself, such as weather, neighborhood information, or even rocket launches. While we can simply show every entity by domain, we know we can make these function-focused dashboards much more useful by exposing insights by curating and juxtaposing information.\nNext priority: Improve privacy in user, guest, and public access\nThe inability to fine-tune access to Home Assistant by guests or other members of the family has been a pain point requested by many of our users. We want to investigate ways to mitigate this while improving the privacy of the household. Our research on what privacy means to users will hopefully bring more clarity to this before we start working on it.\nVoice Assistants\nIn good shape: Improve Assist capabilities out of the box\nAssist, our private voice assistant, received a lot of love over the last 6 months. Our first focus was to improve its capabilities out of the box, without needing to tinker with it. We added a lot of features that were heavily requested by the community, features that bring us one step closer to feature parity with our non-private competitors.\nWe brought area awareness, which allows you to target devices in the same area without mentioning the area (like “Close the curtains” or “Turn off the lights”). We brought floor support, which allows you to target devices across areas on the same floor; very useful for homes with an open floor design (for example “Turn on all lights on the first floor”).\nTimers running on an S3 Box, with countdown text and a loading bar!\nWe implemented timers, allowing any voice assistant device to “ring” when a timer ends, including supporting the creation of multiple timers. You can also pause and resume them and add or remove time from them. You can combine commands with timers by giving a delayed command, allowing you to perform an action after a specific amount of time (like “Turn off the TV in 30 minutes)”.\nWe also brought the ability to control media via voice. Pausing or resuming them, controlling the volume, and going to the next track. This, combined with the area awareness capability mentioned above made for some really interesting short commands that work in a room with a TV playing or music streaming, such as “Pause”, “Resume” and “Next”.\nFinally, our on-device wake word engine called microWakeWord became much faster and much better at recognizing wake words. This is the result of using real voice data in the training process to fine-tune the models. With Wake Word Collective, you can now contribute by lending your voice to improve our community-driven, privacy-focused voice assistant! You can read more about it in this blog post.\nIn progress: Make Assist easier to start with\nSo Assist is more capable, but what about getting started with Voice?\nVoice is hard because it is a combination of great software and great hardware. Up until recently, we primarily focused on making the software experience great and relied on readily available hardware to power our voice assistants.\nA teaser of our voice hardware\nHowever, this is changing - over the past 6 months, we have built our own hardware! It will be the first voice assistant hardware built from the ground up to work with Home Assistant, fully open source (firmware and hardware), and it is going to be released very soon. It is truly the missing hardware piece to a more approachable voice experience in Home Assistant, and we cannot wait to see what you will build with it.\nLater priority: Make Assist more conversational\nThe more functionality we add to Assist, the more we reach its transactional limitations. Indeed, today, an interaction is one way, from a user (issuing a command) to Assist (acting on that command). We would like to improve this, allowing more conversational interactions with Assist.\nIn the future, Assist will be able to ask for clarifications before fulfilling a command, such as requesting the duration of a timer if it was not part of the original command or asking for confirmation before processing critical actions, such as unlocking all doors. On top of that, we would like to allow the conversation to start from Assist, and not from the user, such as greeting someone when they enter a room.\nThis pairs very well with LLM-based conversation agents due to their ability to retain context, but we will make sure these types of complex interactions are also possible with our default conversation agent.\nResearch\nIn good shape: Build local LLM infrastructure\nIn the past six months, we’ve introduced support for LLM local tools and Ollama, pushing our efforts to make AI more accessible and private for experimentation within Home Assistant. We’ve also dedicated significant effort to creating realistic benchmarks, focusing on natural, conversational use cases rather than edge cases. This approach lets us better understand performance and user experience in day-to-day interactions.\nOur latest benchmark for local language models (LLMs) can be explored here, showcasing how models like qwen2.5 perform in realistic settings. With these insights, we’re continuing to refine LLM integrations and to ensure that LLMs can be depended upon for common use cases at home.\n\nYou can now expand LLM capabilities by allowing them access to your scripts. This feature lets you precisely control what the LLM does in specific situations, while still benefiting from the flexibility and natural language processing that AIs excel at.\nIn progress: Investigate on privacy\nSince our last roadmap update, we have expanded the product and design team working on the Home Assistant project, and we have hired our first ever dedicated user researcher!\nWhile we are ramping up our user research pipeline, we have started working on investigating what privacy means to our users.

We have interviewed a handful of users on this topic recently, and we can’t wait to show you what we have found.\nHome Assistant Cloud\nHome Assistant Cloud, powered by our commercial partner Nabu Casa brings, to the many, the hard-to-reach features of Home Assistant usually reserved for power users with expensive hardware at home, with no compromise on privacy.\nIn recent months, the Nabu Casa team has been hard at work in bringing peace of mind to using Home Assistant. For the cloud backup feature, the Home Assistant team and the Nabu Casa team are now working closely together on a comprehensive revamp of backup integrations, to create an easy one-stop solution to a good backup strategy. We are also working to ensure users have a smooth onboarding for backing up to Home Assistant Cloud, as well as other third-party backup locations.\nThe team had to postpone some features in favor of others like WebRTC. They had successfully released the infrastructure needed to support WebRTC, both STUN servers for every Home Assistant user and TURN servers for every Home Assistant Cloud subscriber, enhancing real-time communication capabilities within Home Assistant. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is one of the postponed features, but it is still in the Nabu Casa pipeline.\nOpen Protocols\nWe remain committed to supporting open smart home standards, including Z-Wave Zigbee, Matter, and Thread, aligning with our Open Home mission to offer choice, privacy, and sustainability through locally controlled, cloud-independent devices.\nIn the past six months, we have made significant steps towards certifications, ensuring our open standards implementations are up to industry standards.\nZ-Wave\nIn September, Paulus, the founder of Home Assistant, announced his new role on the Z-Wave Alliance Board of Directors, representing Nabu Casa.

While a normal section is\ndivided into 4 columns, precise modes gives you 12 columns, which allows you\nto align 2, 3, 4, or 6 buttons side-by-side.</p>\n<h2>Low latency cameras using WebRTC</h2>\n<p>Lots of effort has gone into this new and amazing feature for this release:\n<strong>WebRTC</strong>! 🎉</p>\n<center><p class='no-shadow'><img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Logo of WebRTC\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11/webrtc-logo-horiz-retro.png\" /></p></center>\n<p>Not sure <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC\">what WebRTC is</a>? No worries! Let us try to explain. If you are\nwatching a camera in Home Assistant, you might have noticed it is sometimes\na bit slow and delayed. WebRTC support is going to change that!</p>\n<p>Camera streams will now try to use WebRTC whenever possible.\n<a href=\"https://webrtc.org/\">WebRTC is a standard</a> that makes a peer-to-peer connection for lower-latency\naudio and video streaming. You are probably using this technology a lot already,\nfor example, when having an online video call. When you’re away from home,\nit will try to find the fastest and most direct path between your Home Assistant\ninstance and the camera you are trying to view.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">The Open Home Foundation</a> will host the negotiating network infrastructure\n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN\">STUN servers</a>) <strong>for free for all Home Assistant users</strong> and enable the\ncapability to use WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections whenever possible. If you are using Home Assistant OS or our containers, after you update this will automatically work out of the box.</p>\n<center><p class='no-shadow'><img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Logo of the Open Home Foundation\" src=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/assets/images/logo/open-home-foundation.svg\" style=\"width: 90%\" /></p></center>\n<p>Sometimes, a direct connection between the client (like your browser\nor mobile app) and the camera is not possible; in those situations, the camera\nstream needs to be relayed by an external server. <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> now\nprovides this relay server (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT\">TURN server</a>), and it’s <strong>included as one of the many benefits</strong>\navailable to all subscribers!</p>\n<p>So, no matter where you are, you should always be able to watch your cameras\nvia this low-latency technology. If, for whatever reason, WebRTC is not\navailable, it will fall back to using the old method of streaming to ensure\nyou can always see your camera feeds.</p>\n<p>So, after reading all of this, what changed? Well, camera feeds will do everything they did before, but will be faster, more responsive, and less delayed! 🎉</p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

This allows MQTT devices to be set up\nand discovered once instead of separately for each entity; which is much\nmore efficient. Nice improvement!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>\n<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant\nuser interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving\nmore integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone\nto set up and use.</p>\n<p>The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/integrations/local_file\">Local file</a></strong>, done by <a href=\"https://github.com/gjohansson-ST\">@gjohansson-ST</a></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/integrations/onkyo\">Onkyo</a></strong>, done by <a href=\"https://github.com/Nebula83\">@Nebula83</a></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/integrations/smarty\">Smarty</a></strong>, done by <a href=\"https://github.com/joostlek\">@joostlek</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>\n<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are also no longer available as\nof this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bloomsky</strong>.

It is now easier to manage and configure your network settings,\nincluding nicer handling of IP addresses, improved Wi-Fi configuration,\nand better visibility on the URLs Home Assistant is using for your instance.</li>\n<li>We now indicate if a custom integration is overriding a built-in integration.\nThis makes it easier to spot if a custom integration is taking over a\nbuilt-in integration while you are wondering why you didn’t get the latest\nfeatures Home Assistant releases bring. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/MindFreeze\">@MindFreeze</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Live logs</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, if something does not work as expected, you might resort to a more technical\ntool for finding out what is going on: The logs.</p>\n<p>Previously, if you looked at the logs of, for example, an add-on or the Home\nAssistant Supervisor, you would only see the last 100 log lines. You would\nhave had to refresh the page to see new log entries.</p>\n<p>Well, no more! As of this release, the logs are now <strong>streaming live</strong>! 🎉</p>\n<p class='img no-shadow'><img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the imported cards section\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11/streaming-live-logs.gif\"/>Screen recording demonstrating logs showing up as they happen.</p>\n<p>And not just that, you can scroll back in time to see previous log items.\nThat’s a pretty cool improvement. 😎</p>\n<h2>Voice</h2>\n<p>Last year, 2023, was the <a href=\"/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/\">Year of the Voice</a> for Home Assistant. And while this\nyear isn’t specifically dedicated to voice, everyone is still working hard\ntowards the goal of letting users control their homes with their voice in\ntheir own language.</p>\n<p>As you might have heard through many community channels 🕵️‍♀️, we are working to\nmake this a reality for everyone. We are hard at work getting our Home Assistant\nvoice satellite hardware ready and available for selling and shipping! 🤗</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more information on that soon!</p>\n<h3>Home Assistant intents improvements</h3>\n<p>One of the things we are working on is the Home Assistant intents. This is a\nway for a voice assistant to understand the intention behind your spoken\nsentences. This is a very crucial part of a local voice assistant.</p>\n<p>In this release, we decided to align and combine Canadian French and French languages for the time being. Though we understand it is a unique dialect, this is about giving Canadian French users a lot more voice features.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-11/canadian-french-on-assist.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a few commands in Canadian French before and after this release\" /></p>\n<p>These intents are built and maintained by the community, and we are very\ngrateful for their work. For example, <a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya\">@piitaya</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jlpouffier\">@jlpouffier</a> have made a\ngreat effort to lead the French language intents mentioned above.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, we want to ensure everyone can use Home Assistant in their\nown language, <strong>so we need your help</strong>! Help the community by contributing to\nthe intents for your language. You can find more information on how to do that\nin our <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/contributing\">developer documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Join the Wake Word Collective</h3>\n<p>Another essential part of voice is the Wake Word! And this is where <strong>everyone</strong>,\nno matter your skill level, can help out with just a minute of your time!</p>\n<p>Wake words are the words you say to wake up your voice assistant. For example,\n<em>“Hey Google”</em> or <em>“Alexa”</em>. As we are building our own voice assistant with\nour own wake words, we need to train our models to recognize these words,\nregardless of your accent, language, gender, or age.</p>\n<p>So, get your whole home involved 🏠! Take a minute to help us out by recording your voice\nsaying the wake word. It is super easy, and you can do it right from your\nbrowser or mobile, no need to install anything!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/\"><strong>Help us improve our wake words today! ❤️</strong></a></p>\n<p>You can read more about the Wake Word Collective in our\n<a href=\"/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/\">dedicated blog post</a>.</p>\n<h2>Patch releases</h2>\n<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.11 in November.\nThese patch releases only contain bug fixes.

    "sanitized": "Home Assistant 2024.11! 🎉\nIt is November already, and we are closing in on the end of the year, but we are\nnot slowing down!\nBefore we dive into what this release has to offer, I want to take a moment to\nthank everyone who has contributed to the Home Assistant project. You might\nhave heard this already, but going to share it again:\nWe are number one! 🥇\nGitHub published its annual Octoverse report, highlighting the platform’s\nbiggest trends and projects. It named Home Assistant 2024’s largest open-source\nproject, with over 21,000 contributors over the year. That includes you! ❤️\nContinuing the festivities, this release is a big one! The new dashboarding\nsystem we have been working on all year is now out of its experimental phase\nand generally available! 🥳 Exciting, everyone can now create beautiful\ndashboards with ease!\nTo top it off, this release also supports faster and lower-latency camera\nstreams using WebRTC, supported by the Open Home Foundation.\nThis is a huge improvement! 🎉\nEnjoy the release!\n../Frenck\n\n\nSections dashboard no longer experimental!\n\nConvert your old dashboards to sections view layout\nPrecise mode for card sizes\n\n\nLow latency cameras using WebRTC\nIntegrations\n\nNew integrations\nNoteworthy improvements to existing integrations\nNow available to set up from the UI\nFarewell to the following\n\n\nOther noteworthy changes\n\nLive logs\n\n\nVoice\n\nHome Assistant intents improvements\nJoin the Wake Word Collective\n\n\nPatch releases\n\n2024.11.1 - November 8\n2024.11.2 - November 15\n2024.11.3 - November 22\n\n\nNeed help? Join the community!\nBackward-incompatible changes\nAll changes\n\nSections dashboard no longer experimental!\nThis release marks a big milestone in our pursuit of making dashboards easier to\ncustomize and use for everyone, aka Project Grace! The sections view layout,\ntogether with its drag-and-drop 🐲 capabilities and responsive design,\nis now out of its experimental phase, and ready for primetime! This means\nthat, as of this release, you will get our awesome feature-rich and easy-to-use\ndashboard editing experience when you create a new dashboard. 🎉\nOver the past few months, we have worked hard to iterate and listen to your\nfeedback to ensure that our new dashboard is easy to customize for both\nbeginners and advanced users alike. We have added new capabilities such as\nresizing cards, visibility options, wider sections, new badges,\nand, most recently, adding the new heading card.\nTo finish this journey, we are adding two more features to this release.\nConvert your old dashboards to sections view layout\nScreenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections\nThis release includes a way to convert individual dashboard views from the old\nmasonry view layout to the new sections view layout. When you change the view\ntype to sections, you get a button to convert the view. All the cards of the\nold view are then copied and placed in an imported cards section in the new\nview, and you can then easily drag-and-drop them into the right sections.\nPlease note that cards placed within the imported cards section are only visible\nto users once moved to a section above the fold. This ensures that\ncards do not get accidentally shown in the wrong sections while you are still\nworking on the dashboard.\nScreenshot of the imported cards section\nIf you are not ready for the new layout yet, no worries! Your old dashboard view\nis kept when a new dashboard is created, giving an excellent way for masonry\nview veterans to try out sections while keeping all the hard work they have put\ninto customizing their cards.\nAlternatively, you can move each card one-by-one from another view. All moved\ncards will also be temporarily placed in the imported cards section.\nPrecise mode for card sizes\nExamples of cards using precise mode\nIf you love tinkering with your dashboards and fine-tuning card sizes with more\nprecision, you now have even more control over the size of cards. In the layout\noptions of a card you can now enable “Precise mode”, which will give you three\ntimes more options for the card widths!\nPrecise mode is applied on a card-by-card level. While a normal section is\ndivided into 4 columns, precise modes gives you 12 columns, which allows you\nto align 2, 3, 4, or 6 buttons side-by-side.\nLow latency cameras using WebRTC\nLots of effort has gone into this new and amazing feature for this release:\nWebRTC! 🎉\n\nNot sure what WebRTC is? No worries! Let us try to explain. If you are\nwatching a camera in Home Assistant, you might have noticed it is sometimes\na bit slow and delayed. WebRTC support is going to change that!\nCamera streams will now try to use WebRTC whenever possible.\nWebRTC is a standard that makes a peer-to-peer connection for lower-latency\naudio and video streaming. You are probably using this technology a lot already,\nfor example, when having an online video call. When you’re away from home,\nit will try to find the fastest and most direct path between your Home Assistant\ninstance and the camera you are trying to view.\nThe Open Home Foundation will host the negotiating network infrastructure\n(STUN servers) for free for all Home Assistant users and enable the\ncapability to use WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections whenever possible. If you are using Home Assistant OS or our containers, after you update this will automatically work out of the box.\n\nSometimes, a direct connection between the client (like your browser\nor mobile app) and the camera is not possible; in those situations, the camera\nstream needs to be relayed by an external server. Home Assistant Cloud now\nprovides this relay server (TURN server), and it’s included as one of the many benefits\navailable to all subscribers!\nSo, no matter where you are, you should always be able to watch your cameras\nvia this low-latency technology. If, for whatever reason, WebRTC is not\navailable, it will fall back to using the old method of streaming to ensure\nyou can always see your camera feeds.\nSo, after reading all of this, what changed? Well, camera feeds will do everything they did before, but will be faster, more responsive, and less delayed! 🎉\nIntegrations\nThanks to our community for keeping pace with the new integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more]\nand improvements to existing ones! You’re all awesome 🥰\nNew integrations\nWe welcome the following new integrations in this release:\n\nLG ThinQ, added by @LG-ThinQ-Integration\nIntegrate your LG ThinQ devices, such as air conditioners, refrigerators,\nand washing machines. LG built and provided this integration! It’s super nice\nto see a manufacturer providing an integration for Home Assistant.\nHusqvarna Automower BLE, added by @alistair23\nIntegrate your Husqvarna lawnmower using Bluetooth.\nPalazzetti, added by @dotvav\nIntegrate your Palazzetti pellet stove; control the stove, fan speeds and get the current temperature.\n\nNoteworthy improvements to existing integrations\nIt is not just new integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] that have been added; existing\nintegrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy\nchanges to existing integrations:\n\n@joostlek has extended the Spotify integration with a whole bunch of new\nsensors for the current song playing. You can now, for example, automate\nputting your house into party mode 🎉 when the song playing is danceable\nenough 😎 Awesome job!\nThe LinkPlay integration now has multiroom support! Group and ungroup your\ndevices to play music in sync or individually straight from Home Assistant.\nThanks @silamon!\nStaying in the audio department, @mj23000 added shuffle and repeat controls\nto the Bang & Olufsen integration. Nice!\nThe ViCare integration now supports room sensors and hot water storage\nsensors. Thanks for that @CFenner!\n@starkillerOG added sensors to track the total number of installations and\nintegrations to the Analytics Insights integration. Nice!\nThe Habitica integration now supports sensors for gems, mystic hourglasses,\nand calendars for to-dos and daily tasks. Thanks @tr4nt0r!\n@YogevBokobza added support for the Switcher Runner S12 to the\nSwitcher integration. Thanks for that!\nThe Husqvarna Automower integration keeps receiving love from @Thomas55555.\nThis release adds work area and progress sensors. Nice!\n@bdraco added support for the SwitchBot Meter Pro to the\nSwitchBot integration. Thanks!\nThe SwitchBot Cloud integration now supports locks! Thanks @miterion!\nA little more technical, but @jbouwh added support for\nMQTT device-based auto discovery. This allows MQTT devices to be set up\nand discovered once instead of separately for each entity; which is much\nmore efficient. Nice improvement!\n\nNow available to set up from the UI\nWhile most integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] can be set up directly from the Home Assistant\nuser interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving\nmore integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone\nto set up and use.\nThe following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:\n\nLocal file, done by @gjohansson-ST\nOnkyo, done by @Nebula83\nSmarty, done by @joostlek\n\nFarewell to the following\nThe following integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] are also no longer available as\nof this release:\n\nBloomsky. Their service shut down.\nGoogle Domains. The domain registration service by Google has been\nshut down.\nSpider. The service is no longer available.\n\nOther noteworthy changes\nThere are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other\nnoteworthy changes:\n\nImage entities now have a snapshot action, allowing you to save the current\nimage in the entity to a file. Nice @NickM-27!\n@Petro31 added (limited) template support to the “at” field of time triggers.\nThis allows you to template the time of that trigger in, for example,\na blueprint automation.\nNautical miles (nmi) is now a valid distance unit. This means you can now\nuse this as a unit for your distance sensors. Thanks @mib1185!\n@tetele added blueprints for template entities! This allows for easier\nre-use and sharing of common blueprints for sets of templated entities.\nThis is an advanced feature and is only available using manual YAML\nconfiguration.\n@MindFreeze and @matthiasdebaat have improved the network settings user\ninterface. It is now easier to manage and configure your network settings,\nincluding nicer handling of IP addresses, improved Wi-Fi configuration,\nand better visibility on the URLs Home Assistant is using for your instance.\nWe now indicate if a custom integration is overriding a built-in integration.\nThis makes it easier to spot if a custom integration is taking over a\nbuilt-in integration while you are wondering why you didn’t get the latest\nfeatures Home Assistant releases bring. Thanks, @MindFreeze!\n\nLive logs\nSometimes, if something does not work as expected, you might resort to a more technical\ntool for finding out what is going on: The logs.\nPreviously, if you looked at the logs of, for example, an add-on or the Home\nAssistant Supervisor, you would only see the last 100 log lines. You would\nhave had to refresh the page to see new log entries.\nWell, no more! As of this release, the logs are now streaming live! 🎉\nScreen recording demonstrating logs showing up as they happen.\nAnd not just that, you can scroll back in time to see previous log items.\nThat’s a pretty cool improvement. 😎\nVoice\nLast year, 2023, was the Year of the Voice for Home Assistant. And while this\nyear isn’t specifically dedicated to voice, everyone is still working hard\ntowards the goal of letting users control their homes with their voice in\ntheir own language.\nAs you might have heard through many community channels 🕵️‍♀️, we are working to\nmake this a reality for everyone. We are hard at work getting our Home Assistant\nvoice satellite hardware ready and available for selling and shipping! 🤗\nStay tuned for more information on that soon!\nHome Assistant intents improvements\nOne of the things we are working on is the Home Assistant intents. This is a\nway for a voice assistant to understand the intention behind your spoken\nsentences. This is a very crucial part of a local voice assistant.\nIn this release, we decided to align and combine Canadian French and French languages for the time being. Though we understand it is a unique dialect, this is about giving Canadian French users a lot more voice features.\n\nThese intents are built and maintained by the community, and we are very\ngrateful for their work. For example, @piitaya and @jlpouffier have made a\ngreat effort to lead the French language intents mentioned above.\nNevertheless, we want to ensure everyone can use Home Assistant in their\nown language, so we need your help! Help the community by contributing to\nthe intents for your language. You can find more information on how to do that\nin our developer documentation.\nJoin the Wake Word Collective\nAnother essential part of voice is the Wake Word! And this is where everyone,\nno matter your skill level, can help out with just a minute of your time!\nWake words are the words you say to wake up your voice assistant. For example,\n“Hey Google” or “Alexa”. As we are building our own voice assistant with\nour own wake words, we need to train our models to recognize these words,\nregardless of your accent, language, gender, or age.\nSo, get your whole home involved 🏠! Take a minute to help us out by recording your voice\nsaying the wake word. It is super easy, and you can do it right from your\nbrowser or mobile, no need to install anything!\nHelp us improve our wake words today! ❤️\nYou can read more about the Wake Word Collective in our\ndedicated blog post.\nPatch releases\nWe will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.11 in November.\nThese patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch\nrelease every Friday.\n2024.11.1 - November 8\n\nBump intents to 2024.11.6 (@synesthesiam - #129982)\nFix Trunks in Teslemetry and Tesla Fleet (@Bre77 - #129986)\nUpdate sense energy library to 0.13.3 (@kbickar -

Unfortunately, sometimes,\nit is inevitable.\nWe always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as\npossible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:\n\n  \n    \n      A. O. Smith\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nA. O. Smith now provides the hot water status as a percentage rather than low,\nmedium, or high. The hot water status entity has been updated accordingly.\n(@bdr99 - #127678) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Google Calendar\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nGoogle Calendar events that are declined are now omitted from the calendar.\n(@joelhawksley - #128900) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      HomeKit\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nHistorically, many integrations implemented doorbells as binary sensors with a\ndevice class of occupancy. This design was replaced with the new event entities,\nwhich use a purpose-built device class of doorbell.\nHomeKit will no longer automatically link binary sensors with device class\noccupancy as linked doorbell sensors. However, linked doorbell sensors can\nstill be configured manually via YAML.\n(@bdraco - #127668) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Litter-Robot\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nPreviously, Litter-Robot could have an off state. This has now changed to\ndocked, as off isn’t a valid state for vacuum entities.\n(@gjohansson-ST - #128297) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Netatmo\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThe preset modes of the thermostat have been renamed in order to support\ntranslations Schedule, Frost guard, and Manual have been renamed to\nschedule, frost_guard, and manual.\n(@piitaya - #128890) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Tibber\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThe tibber.get_prices action has been adjusted to return datetimes as strings\ninstead of raw datetime objects.\nAutomations or template sensors using this may need to be modified with an\nas_datetime filter. See our templating documentation\nfor more information on using these filters.\n(@functionpointer - #123901) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Updates\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nState attributes of update entities have been changed:\n\nThe in_progress state attribute is now always a bool, never an integer.\nA new state attribute update_percentage has been added. The\nupdate_percentage is a number between 0-100 if an update is in progress\nand the entity supports reporting progress, or None if an update is not\nin progress or an update is in progress but the entity does not support\nreporting progress.\n\nScripts, automations, custom frontend components, etc., which consume the\nin_progress state attribute of update entities, need to be updated accordingly.\n(@emontnemery - #128877) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      WMS WebControl pro\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThe open/closed state of awnings will be inverted so that the UI visualization\nand positioning match reality. This means open (100%) now refers to the awning\nbeing completely retracted, and closed (0%) now means the awning is fully\nexpanded. This is not in line with industry terminology, but Home Assistant\ndoes not yet natively support awnings of type patio.\n(@mback2k - #128079) (documentation)\n\n  \n\nIf you are a custom integration developer and want to learn about changes and\nnew features available for your integration: Be sure to follow our\ndeveloper blog. The following are the most notable for this release:\n\nChanges to the UnitOfConductivity enum\nChanges to the update entity\nDeprecating state constants for cover\nExtend deprecation period of hass.helpers\nNew alarm control panel state property and state enum\nNew helpers and best practises for reauth and reconfigure flows\nReauth and reconfigure flows need to be linked to a config entry\nThe core config class has been moved\n\nAll changes\nOf course, there is a lot more in this release.

A couple more similar issues were reported, and we began a dialogue with the small number of people who were affected, having them send us the devices to test.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-10-zbt1-issue/zbt1-issue.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"ZBT-1 case deformation and faulty voltage regulator\">Circled in red the deformation on the case and the board showing the failed chip</p>\n<p>Indeed, the device no longer worked at all, not being detected by any device it was connected to. When we opened them, we found a dead voltage regulator. Though SkyConnect devices can also develop a small discoloration on the outside casing after long-term use, and this is not a sign of failure, the deeper deformation in the outer casing pictured above is a sign that the ZBT-1 has overheated and failed. All of our devices are certified by CE and ROHS, and the plastic shell has been designed not to combust. This is a real-life demonstration of just how important this certification is and why we take that step.</p>\n<p>We replaced the voltage regulator on the devices we tested, and the devices sprang back to life. We found our culprit, but why was it failing? As mentioned, the SkyConnect internal design and the manufacturing were effectively identical to the ZBT-1, and we received no reports of any such failures in the literally tens of thousands of them in the wild. In manufacturing runs there is always a little variance, and in this run, something went wrong with the voltage regulator that was sourced - again, we’re looking into this.</p>\n<p>It took us a couple of weeks to replicate the problem with our own units. We went down some wrong paths, but eventually found it was triggered only by certain devices, specifically certain desktop PCs (internally, we have only found one desktop that causes this failure). We have not observed the failure occur when the device has only been connected to a Home Assistant Green, Raspberry Pi, or even a Mac. If you have plugged your ZBT-1 into a different device, specifically a desktop PC, and it is not recognized by that system, inspect it for this deformation pictured above. Obviously, we want you to be able to use the device with any hardware, and even if only a small number of devices from this production run have reported issues, it is still unacceptable to us.</p>\n<h2>Do I have a ZBT-1?</h2>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-10-zbt1-issue/skyconnect-zbt1.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"SkyConnect (left) and ZBT-1 (right)\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 0.9rem;\">SkyConnect (left) and ZBT-1 (right) branded devices, SkyConnect are unaffected by this issue.</p>\n<h2>Pausing sales</h2>\n<p>We have asked our distributors to pause sales and return all stock. For the next month, you will see “Out of Stock” banners, and if you are attempting to get a replacement device for a failed unit, this will not be possible until production is resumed.</p>\n<p>We are working to have replacement ZBT-1s shipped by early November.</p>\n<h2>Replacement Program</h2>\n<p>If you have purchased Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1, we are working on a replacement program. This program will see Nabu Casa provide a replacement device free of charge for a period of 60 months (5 years) for verified purchases. Regardless of whether the device has failed, we will provide a replacement upon request.</p>\n<p>It is a core value of ours to do things as sustainably as possible, and that’s why we’ve provided such a long coverage period. We want to give owners with working ZBT-1s, who do not expect to use the device in a different system for the foreseeable future, the ability to keep it operating with peace of mind.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-note\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>\n  <p class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>All ZBT-1 branded devices produced, as of October 2024, are believed to have this fault. You can tell if your device is a ZBT-1 by checking the white label on the back for “ZBT-1” (identify which device you have <a href=\"#do-i-have-a-zbt-1\">with this graphic</a>). There is no need to test if your device is affected by this fault.</p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>If it’s working, keep it plugged into the device it’s working with, and don’t worry about a replacement until you need it. If you need or want a replacement, please contact the seller where you purchased your device, and they will arrange the return process and replacement. Replacement devices are expected by early November, and we will be prioritizing people with non-functioning devices.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We’re sorry for the inconvenience and any disruption to your smart home. As someone who uses Zigbee in their home, which many smart devices rely on, I would hate to have it out of commission.</p>\n<p>Worse things can happen, but this has been a gut punch. All our work at Nabu Casa is to fund the development of Home Assistant and support the Open Home. Issues like this eat into our time, and rob our users of new and great things. Ultimately, we’re going to take this setback as a chance to prove we stand by our values and do the right thing.</p>\n",

A couple more similar issues were reported, and we began a dialogue with the small number of people who were affected, having them send us the devices to test.\nCircled in red the deformation on the case and the board showing the failed chip\nIndeed, the device no longer worked at all, not being detected by any device it was connected to. When we opened them, we found a dead voltage regulator. Though SkyConnect devices can also develop a small discoloration on the outside casing after long-term use, and this is not a sign of failure, the deeper deformation in the outer casing pictured above is a sign that the ZBT-1 has overheated and failed. All of our devices are certified by CE and ROHS, and the plastic shell has been designed not to combust. This is a real-life demonstration of just how important this certification is and why we take that step.\nWe replaced the voltage regulator on the devices we tested, and the devices sprang back to life. We found our culprit, but why was it failing? As mentioned, the SkyConnect internal design and the manufacturing were effectively identical to the ZBT-1, and we received no reports of any such failures in the literally tens of thousands of them in the wild. In manufacturing runs there is always a little variance, and in this run, something went wrong with the voltage regulator that was sourced - again, we’re looking into this.\nIt took us a couple of weeks to replicate the problem with our own units. We went down some wrong paths, but eventually found it was triggered only by certain devices, specifically certain desktop PCs (internally, we have only found one desktop that causes this failure). We have not observed the failure occur when the device has only been connected to a Home Assistant Green, Raspberry Pi, or even a Mac. If you have plugged your ZBT-1 into a different device, specifically a desktop PC, and it is not recognized by that system, inspect it for this deformation pictured above. Obviously, we want you to be able to use the device with any hardware, and even if only a small number of devices from this production run have reported issues, it is still unacceptable to us.\nDo I have a ZBT-1?\n\nSkyConnect (left) and ZBT-1 (right) branded devices, SkyConnect are unaffected by this issue.\nPausing sales\nWe have asked our distributors to pause sales and return all stock. For the next month, you will see “Out of Stock” banners, and if you are attempting to get a replacement device for a failed unit, this will not be possible until production is resumed.\nWe are working to have replacement ZBT-1s shipped by early November.\nReplacement Program\nIf you have purchased Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1, we are working on a replacement program. This program will see Nabu Casa provide a replacement device free of charge for a period of 60 months (5 years) for verified purchases. Regardless of whether the device has failed, we will provide a replacement upon request.\nIt is a core value of ours to do things as sustainably as possible, and that’s why we’ve provided such a long coverage period. We want to give owners with working ZBT-1s, who do not expect to use the device in a different system for the foreseeable future, the ability to keep it operating with peace of mind.\n\n   Note\n  \nAll ZBT-1 branded devices produced, as of October 2024, are believed to have this fault. You can tell if your device is a ZBT-1 by checking the white label on the back for “ZBT-1” (identify which device you have with this graphic). There is no need to test if your device is affected by this fault.\n  \n\nIf it’s working, keep it plugged into the device it’s working with, and don’t worry about a replacement until you need it. If you need or want a replacement, please contact the seller where you purchased your device, and they will arrange the return process and replacement. Replacement devices are expected by early November, and we will be prioritizing people with non-functioning devices.\nConclusion\nWe’re sorry for the inconvenience and any disruption to your smart home. As someone who uses Zigbee in their home, which many smart devices rely on, I would hate to have it out of commission.\nWorse things can happen, but this has been a gut punch. All our work at Nabu Casa is to fund the development of Home Assistant and support the Open Home. Issues like this eat into our time, and rob our users of new and great things. Ultimately, we’re going to take this setback as a chance to prove we stand by our values and do the right thing."

It allows you to add titles or\nsubtitles to your dashboards, make them clickable, and even add cute little\nentities to them. The new section dashboard gets better and better with every\nrelease, which is super exciting!</p>\n<p>We also introduce some small YAML automation syntax changes.

Section titles are replaced with their own card,\ncalled the <a href=\"/dashboards/heading/\">heading card</a>. Making them a card rather than an inline title gives\nyou a lot more flexibility, allowing you to put them nearly anywhere.</p>\n<p>The heading card can be used to make titles, but also subtitles, which are half\nthe height and have smaller, lighter text. So, if you have ever had a section\nthat needs to be subdivided, slap a subtitle in there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-10/headings.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a dashboard using heading cards with titles and subtitles\" /></p>\n<p>Titles and subtitles can be made clickable, displaying a chevron\n<iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:chevron-right' title='Chevron right'></iconify-icon> when you can interact with them. This can\nperform an action or navigate to a subpage, like having an energy section title\nnavigate to the full energy dashboard.</p>\n<p>Best of all, if you’ve already added titles to your sections, they will be\nmigrated automatically to the new card. 😎</p>\n<h3>Another headline feature</h3>\n<p>We had such a fantastic reaction when we released our <a href=\"/dashboards/badges/\">renewed badges</a>,\nand this new heading card has something very similar and equally as visually\nappealing. It can show multiple entity states to the right of the title or\nsubtitle.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-10/heading-with-entities.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a dashboard with additional entities shown on card headings\" /></p>\n<p>Either in a subtle “no color” default or add a splash of color when the entity\nis in an active state. Other customization options for these entities include\nchanging the icon, visibility, and what happens when you select it.</p>\n<h2>Repairs for long-term statistics</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://data.home-assistant.io/docs/statistics/\">Long-term statistics</a> are great; they downsample and store the data produced\nby your <span class='terminology'>sensors<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Sensors return information about a thing, for instance the level of water in a tank.<a class='terminology-link' href='/integrations/sensor/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>, allowing Home Assistant to store data indefinitely\nin a fraction of the space the original readings took up. Take a look back at\n<a href=\"/docs/energy/\">your energy usage</a> from two years ago, or see if your living room really is\ncolder this year compared to last.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-10/statistics-repair.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a long-term statistic repair showing up in the settings menu\" /></p>\n<p>In the past, if a statistic encountered an issue, it might be quietly broken\nuntil you dig into the statistics page. Now, Home Assistant will raise a repair\nnotification when it detects issues with a long-term statistic and give\nyou options for fixing the issue.</p>\n<h2>Improved YAML syntax for automations</h2>\n<p>Recently, we renamed <code>service</code> to <code>action</code> in the <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#goodbye-service-calls-hello-actions-\">Home Assistant UI and YAML</a>.\nThis was done with the goal of making the syntax more natural, allowing it\nto be easier to grasp and read. We want to continue this work to improve the\n<span class='terminology'>YAML<span class='terminology-tooltip'>YAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the <code>configuration.yaml</code> or <code>automations.yaml</code> files.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/yaml/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> syntax, this time focusing on <span class='terminology'>automations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Automations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>, and we’ve made the\nfollowing changes,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The top-level <code>trigger</code> key is now <code>triggers</code> (plural)</li>\n<li>The top-level <code>condition</code> key is now <code>conditions</code> (plural)</li>\n<li>The top-level <code>action</code> key is now <code>actions</code> (plural)</li>\n<li>The <code>platform</code> key of a trigger definition is now <code>trigger</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result of all this is that YAML automation syntax now has <code>triggers</code> with\nmultiple <code>trigger</code> definitions, <code>conditions</code> with multiple <code>condition</code>\ndefinitions, and <code>actions</code> with multiple <code>action</code> definitions.</p>\n<p>Here is a small example of an automation highlighting these changes.</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-10/YAML-automation-syntax-changes.png\" alt=\"Screenshots; left showing the old automation YAML style, right showing the new style. The differences between them have been highlighted.\">\nThe 2024.9 release on the left and this 2024.10 release on the right.\n</p>\n<p>As with the other syntax changes we’ve done recently, this is\n<strong>not a breaking change</strong>, and there will be no deprecation. The previous syntax\nwill continue to work, and there are no plans to remove the old syntax. The new\nsyntax is recommended, and all documentation and examples have been updated.\nAutomations managed by the automation editor will automatically be migrated to\nthe new syntax when saving an automation.</p>\n<p>This is not the only change to our syntax, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a> we now support\n<a href=\"/docs/automation/trigger/#merging-lists-of-triggers\">merging a list of triggers</a>, which is mostly useful for\n<span class='terminology'>blueprint<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A blueprint is a script, automation or template entity configuration with certain parts marked as configurable. This allows users to create multiple scripts, automations or template entities based on the same blueprint, with each having its own configuration-specific settings.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/blueprint/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> authors.</p>\n<h2>Faster upgrades when using custom integrations</h2>\n<p>We want Home Assistant to continue to work on a wide range of hardware. If you\nlook at our <a href=\"https://analytics.home-assistant.io/\">opt-in analytics</a> you’ll see a sizable amount of homes running it\non single-board computers from the mid-2010s. A lot of effort has been put into\nkeeping Home Assistant lean, and this release has some good improvements. This\nis specially for users of custom integrations, and this follows HACS getting a\ngreat <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/21/hacs-the-best-way-to-share-community-made-projects/#faster-downloads\">speed boost for downloads</a>.</p>\n<p>On each upgrade, all dependencies needed for <span class='terminology'>custom integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A custom integration is an integration that has been created by someone from the Home Assistant community and has been published for others to use at their own risk. Custom integrations are not supported by the Home Assistant project. They are not reviewed or tested by the Home Assistant development team and thus may negatively impact the stability of your Home Assistant instance. An example of a custom integration is the <a href=\"https://spook.boo/\">Spook</a> integration.</span></span>\nare now downloaded and installed. We are now using <code>uv</code> internally to download\nand install dependencies, which is a faster and more efficient way to download\nand install dependencies. If you’re not aware, <code>uv</code> is what makes our release\nprocess so fast nowadays, and <a href=\"https://github.com/edenhaus\">@edenhaus</a> has done an interesting\n<a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/04/03/build-images-with-uv/\">developer backstory</a> on our move from <code>pip</code> to <code>uv</code> (saving us 200+ hours\nof execution time a month). <a href=\"https://github.com/edenhaus\">@edenhaus</a> has also implemented <code>uv</code> at runtime\nas well.</p>\n<p>This speeds up the upgrade process, especially for custom integrations with many\ndependencies, or installations with many custom integrations. This change is\nfully transparent to the user, and no action is required. Just sit down, relax,\nand enjoy the faster upgrade process!</p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

Nice, <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gjohansson-ST\">@gjohansson-ST</a> added a new template function <a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#merge-action-responses\"><code>merge_response</code></a> that\nallows you to merge multiple responses of a single action or multiple actions\ninto a single response. Nice!</li>\n<li><a href=\"/integrations/template/#trigger-based-template-binary-sensors-buttons-images-numbers-selects-and-sensors\">Trigger-based templates</a> now have support for adding conditions! Just like\nautomations, you can now add conditions to these entities to control when\nthey are rendered. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/chammp\">@chammp</a>!</li>\n<li>More template fun! You can now set up your templated alarm control panel\nstraight from the UI. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/gjohansson-ST\">@gjohansson-ST</a>!</li>\n<li>The statistics developer tools have been improved.

    "sanitized": "Boo! 👻\nPlease don’t be scared; it is October, Halloween is coming, and so is the next\nHome Assistant release: 2024.10! 🎃\nThe release we bring you today is a perfect mix of new UI features, advanced\nfeatures, improvements, and lots of bug fixes while not being too overwhelming.\nThere is something for everyone in this release.\nMost notably, we have a brand new heading card. It allows you to add titles or\nsubtitles to your dashboards, make them clickable, and even add cute little\nentities to them. The new section dashboard gets better and better with every\nrelease, which is super exciting!\nWe also introduce some small YAML automation syntax changes. If you are still\na sucker for writing your automations in YAMLYAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the configuration.yaml or automations.yaml files. [Learn more] (like me), I’m sure you’ll love\nthese little tweaks that make it all feel more natural.\nEnjoy the release!\n../Frenck\n\n\nHeading in the right direction\n\nAnother headline feature\n\n\nRepairs for long-term statistics\nImproved YAML syntax for automations\nFaster upgrades when using custom integrations\nIntegrations\n\nNew integrations\nNoteworthy improvements to existing integrations\nNow available to set up from the UI\n\n\nMatter\nOther noteworthy changes\n\nThe source of a repair\nYAML-editor improvements\n\n\nPatch releases\n\n2024.10.1 - October 4\n2024.10.2 - October 11\n2024.10.3 - October 18\n2024.10.4 - October 25\n\n\nNeed help? Join the community!\nBackward-incompatible changes\nAll changes\n\nHeading in the right direction\nUpdate after update, Sections continues to become a customization powerhouse,\nand this month is no exception. Section titles are replaced with their own card,\ncalled the heading card. Making them a card rather than an inline title gives\nyou a lot more flexibility, allowing you to put them nearly anywhere.\nThe heading card can be used to make titles, but also subtitles, which are half\nthe height and have smaller, lighter text. So, if you have ever had a section\nthat needs to be subdivided, slap a subtitle in there.\n\nTitles and subtitles can be made clickable, displaying a chevron\n when you can interact with them. This can\nperform an action or navigate to a subpage, like having an energy section title\nnavigate to the full energy dashboard.\nBest of all, if you’ve already added titles to your sections, they will be\nmigrated automatically to the new card. 😎\nAnother headline feature\nWe had such a fantastic reaction when we released our renewed badges,\nand this new heading card has something very similar and equally as visually\nappealing. It can show multiple entity states to the right of the title or\nsubtitle.\n\nEither in a subtle “no color” default or add a splash of color when the entity\nis in an active state. Other customization options for these entities include\nchanging the icon, visibility, and what happens when you select it.\nRepairs for long-term statistics\nLong-term statistics are great; they downsample and store the data produced\nby your sensorsSensors return information about a thing, for instance the level of water in a tank. [Learn more], allowing Home Assistant to store data indefinitely\nin a fraction of the space the original readings took up. Take a look back at\nyour energy usage from two years ago, or see if your living room really is\ncolder this year compared to last.\n\nIn the past, if a statistic encountered an issue, it might be quietly broken\nuntil you dig into the statistics page. Now, Home Assistant will raise a repair\nnotification when it detects issues with a long-term statistic and give\nyou options for fixing the issue.\nImproved YAML syntax for automations\nRecently, we renamed service to action in the Home Assistant UI and YAML.\nThis was done with the goal of making the syntax more natural, allowing it\nto be easier to grasp and read. We want to continue this work to improve the\nYAMLYAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the configuration.yaml or automations.yaml files. [Learn more] syntax, this time focusing on automationsAutomations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home. [Learn more], and we’ve made the\nfollowing changes,\n\nThe top-level trigger key is now triggers (plural)\nThe top-level condition key is now conditions (plural)\nThe top-level action key is now actions (plural)\nThe platform key of a trigger definition is now trigger\n\nThe result of all this is that YAML automation syntax now has triggers with\nmultiple trigger definitions, conditions with multiple condition\ndefinitions, and actions with multiple action definitions.\nHere is a small example of an automation highlighting these changes.\n\n\nThe 2024.9 release on the left and this 2024.10 release on the right.\n\nAs with the other syntax changes we’ve done recently, this is\nnot a breaking change, and there will be no deprecation. The previous syntax\nwill continue to work, and there are no plans to remove the old syntax. The new\nsyntax is recommended, and all documentation and examples have been updated.\nAutomations managed by the automation editor will automatically be migrated to\nthe new syntax when saving an automation.\nThis is not the only change to our syntax, thanks to @karwosts we now support\nmerging a list of triggers, which is mostly useful for\nblueprintA blueprint is a script, automation or template entity configuration with certain parts marked as configurable. This allows users to create multiple scripts, automations or template entities based on the same blueprint, with each having its own configuration-specific settings. [Learn more] authors.\nFaster upgrades when using custom integrations\nWe want Home Assistant to continue to work on a wide range of hardware. If you\nlook at our opt-in analytics you’ll see a sizable amount of homes running it\non single-board computers from the mid-2010s. A lot of effort has been put into\nkeeping Home Assistant lean, and this release has some good improvements. This\nis specially for users of custom integrations, and this follows HACS getting a\ngreat speed boost for downloads.\nOn each upgrade, all dependencies needed for custom integrationsA custom integration is an integration that has been created by someone from the Home Assistant community and has been published for others to use at their own risk. Custom integrations are not supported by the Home Assistant project. They are not reviewed or tested by the Home Assistant development team and thus may negatively impact the stability of your Home Assistant instance. An example of a custom integration is the Spook integration.\nare now downloaded and installed. We are now using uv internally to download\nand install dependencies, which is a faster and more efficient way to download\nand install dependencies. If you’re not aware, uv is what makes our release\nprocess so fast nowadays, and @edenhaus has done an interesting\ndeveloper backstory on our move from pip to uv (saving us 200+ hours\nof execution time a month). @edenhaus has also implemented uv at runtime\nas well.\nThis speeds up the upgrade process, especially for custom integrations with many\ndependencies, or installations with many custom integrations. This change is\nfully transparent to the user, and no action is required. Just sit down, relax,\nand enjoy the faster upgrade process!\nIntegrations\nThanks to our community for keeping pace with the new integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more]\nand improvements to existing ones! You’re all awesome 🥰\nNew integrations\nWe welcome the following new integrations in this release:\n\nCambridge Audio, added by @noahhusby\nControl all receivers and streamers that support the StreamMagic app.\nDeako Smart Lighting, added by @Balake\nControl and automate your Deako devices.\nDuke Energy, added by @hunterjm\nImport your energy usage data from Duke Energy into the Home Assistant energy\ndashboard.\nGoogle Photos, added by @allenporter\nUpload photos to your Google Photos library and use as a media source.\nNote that only images uploaded by the integration can be viewed and used.\nIskra, added by @iskrakranj\nMonitor your energy and power usage from an Iskra energy meter.\nLektrico Charging Station, added by @Lektrico\nGet in control of your Lektrico EV charger from Home Assistant and optimize\nyour energy usage.\nMonarch Money, added by @jeeftor\nMonitor your account balance using the Monarch Money personal finance service.\nNYT Games, added by @joostlek\nKeep track of your New York Times games progress, like Spelling Bee and Wordle.\nSensoterra, added by @markruys\nMonitor your soil moisture and temperature using Sensoterra sensors.\nTRIGGERcmd, added by @rvmey\nExecute commands on your computer(s) using the TRIGGERcmd cloud service.\nWeheat, added by @jesperraemaekers\nManage and monitor your Weheat heatpump, keeping your home warm and cozy.\nWMS WebControl pro, added by @mback2k\nControl your WAREMA sun shading covers entirely locally.\n\nThis release also has a new virtual integration. Virtual integrations\nare stubs that are handled by other (existing) integrations to help with\nfindability. This one is new:\n\nArizona Public Service (APS), provided by Opower, added by @seferino-fernandez\n\nNoteworthy improvements to existing integrations\nIt is not just new integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] that have been added; existing\nintegrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy\nchanges to existing integrations:\n\n@Bre77 has been busy with the Tesla Fleet integration, adding a bunch of\nnew features and entities to control your Tesla vehicle. It now supports\nclimate, media player, cover, number, select, button, and lock entities.\nYou can now control the volume, ringtone, and status light of your Reolink\nHub! Cool, @starkillerOG!\n@daniel-k added support for controlling the volume and @sdb9696 added a\nswitch for controlling motion detection on Ring devices; Nice work team!\nThe Switchbot Cloud integration now supports the K10+ Mini Robot Vacuum.\nThanks, @Gigatrappeur!\n@sorgfresser extended the ElevenLabs integration with integration options\nto control the voice settings. Nice!\nThe Squeezebox (Lyrion Music Server) integration now has new service sensors,\nand support for  your favorites straight from the media browser.\nThanks, @pssc and @rajlaud!\n@tronikos added Google Cloud speech-to-text (STT) to Home Assistant. This\nallows you to use Google’s Cloud speech-to-text with Assist! Awesome!\nIf you are using the Husqvarna Automower, you can now view the calendar\nit provides, thanks to @Thomas55555!\n@klaasnicolaas added support for home batteries to the Autarco\nintegration so you can use them in your energy dashboard. Great!\n\nNow available to set up from the UI\nWhile most integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] can be set up directly from the Home Assistant\nuser interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving\nmore integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone\nto set up and use.\nThe following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:\n\nEmoncms, done by @alexandrecuer\nGoogle Cloud Platform, done by @tronikos\nHTML5 Push Notifications, done by @alexyao2015\nMold Indicator, done by @gjohansson-ST\n\nMatter\nAt this point, our Matter integration is almost becoming a monthly recurring\ntopic in our release notes. For a good reason! The development is moving forward\nat a strong pace; running toward the certification finish line!\n\nIn terms of stability, we have improved the robustness of the integration to\nensure it sets up correctly every time, even if an issue with one\nof your devices occurs. Besides the usual bugfixes and improvements, this\nrelease has some cool new features and additions:\n\nButton entities\nNew button entities that allow you to perform an action on a device. For\nexample, to identify a device or reset the filter state.\nValve entities\nSupport for water valves, allowing you to control the flow of fluids or gases.\nSupport for operation states\nControl and monitor the operation state of, for example, dishwashers\nand other household equipment.\nSupport for smoke and CO sensors\nMonitor the air quality in your home with smoke and CO sensors.\nAdd support for Matter 1.3 power/energy sensors\nEspecially the energy sensors are great to use with the energy dashboard.\n\nOther noteworthy changes\nThere are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other\nnoteworthy changes this release:\n\nIn June, we added support for adding Model IDs to devices. This release\nhas lots of integrations that add them, including Matter, Plugwise,\nWallbox, and Govee. We are calling for contributions to add model IDs to\nmore integrations! Maybe a cool suggestion for an Hacktoberfest contribution!\n@bmesuere improved the accessibility of all graphs by adjusting all the\ndefault colors used in those graphs! You are a hero!\nWhen you unignore an integration or device on the integrations page,\nHome Assistant will instantly try to rediscover it again! Nice! Thanks,\n@emontnemery!\nWe now have a new unit of measurement for energy entities: calories. Useful,\nfor devices like a treadmill or an exercise bike. Thanks, @dudanov!\n@TrevorSchirmer did something similar, and added a new unit of speed:\nmm/s and in/s. Thank you!\nWhen you rename a device, you will now see more details about the rename\noperation. Including a preview of the new entity IDs. Nice, @karwosts!\n@gjohansson-ST added a new template function merge_response that\nallows you to merge multiple responses of a single action or multiple actions\ninto a single response. Nice!\nTrigger-based templates now have support for adding conditions! Just like\nautomations, you can now add conditions to these entities to control when\nthey are rendered. Thanks, @chammp!\nMore template fun! You can now set up your templated alarm control panel\nstraight from the UI. Thanks, @gjohansson-ST!\nThe statistics developer tools have been improved. They now have the new-style\ndata tables and the ability to bulk select items to action. Awesome @karwosts!\nThere is a new entity in town, the assist satellite entity.\nIt is a building block for remote satellites devices that use Assist. This\nis in preparation for our upcoming satellite hardware. Stay tuned!\n\nThe source of a repair\nIntegrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] can raise issues in your repairs dashboard, they can\nraise issues for themselves, but also for other integrations. An example of\nsuch an issue is an integration that connects to your device that raises an\nissue on an automationAutomations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home. [Learn more] that controls it.\nThe result is an automation issue in your repair center. This is cool, but\nyou might want to know which integration raised the issue in the first place.\nThanks to @wendevlin, we now show the source integration of the repair issue\nin the issue dialog.\n\nYAML-editor improvements\n@naps62 has been busy improving the YAML editor found in the Home Assistant\nuser interface.\nWe now have a vertical line based on indentation, which makes it easier to see\nthe indentation of your YAML configuration and allows you to spot and prevent\nindentation errors.\n\nBut he didn’t stop there. You can now collapse and expand sections of your\nYAML configuration based on the indentation level; which is also demonstrated\nin the screenshot above.\nNice work @naps62!\nPatch releases\nWe will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.10 in October. These\npatch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch release\nevery Friday.\n2024.10.1 - October 4\n\nFix device id support for alarm control panel template (@piitaya - #127340)\nBump pysmlight 0.1.2 (@tl-sl - #127376)\nRemove assumption in ConfigEntryItems about unique unique_id (@emontnemery -

As a result, the OpenTherm Gateway climate entity\nhas been moved to a new OpenTherm Thermostat device.\nConfigurations that look for the climate entity by device must be adjusted\naccordingly.\nIn the process, all entities were reviewed and some were found to be irrelevant\nor superfluous. These entities have been removed.

    "raw": "<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"dSbCzRhbOVA\" videotitle=\"Home Assistant 2024.9 Release Party\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<p>Home Assistant 2024.9! 🎉</p>\n<p>Many community members based in the northern hemisphere have taken advantage of the nicer weather to take a little time off. Home Assistant releases have continued to grow for some time, and this one might not be as gargantuan in size as previous releases, but it still packs some really cool features and announcements.</p>\n<p>This release includes bigger sections, smarter energy monitoring, and a new LLM option. We’ve added <a href=\"#new-integrations\">five</a> new integrations, along with <a href=\"#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui\">one</a> existing integration being added to the UI. On top of all that, we’ve announced a new Works with Home Assistant partner, and the culmination of a project to ensure our project is truly open source.</p>\n<p>We hope you’ve been able to enjoy some time in, and away, from your smart home this month as well.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the release!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#sections-go-big\">Sections go BIG</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#wider-sections\">Wider sections</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#full-span-cards\">Full span cards</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#badges\">Badges</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#tracking-your-untracked-energy\">Tracking your untracked energy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#llm-agent-options-grow\">LLM agent options grow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#aqara-joins-works-with-home-assistant\">Aqara joins Works with Home Assistant</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#open-source-compliance\">Open source compliance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#integrations\">Integrations</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#new-integrations\">New integrations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#noteworthy-improvements-to-existing-integrations\">Noteworthy improvements to existing integrations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui\">Now available to set up from the UI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#farewell-to-the-following\">Farewell to the following</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#patch-releases\">Patch releases</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#202491---september-6\">2024.9.1 - September 6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#202492---september-16\">2024.9.2 - September 16</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#202493---september-24\">2024.9.3 - September 24</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#need-help-join-the-community\">Need help? Join the community!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#backward-incompatible-changes\">Backward-incompatible changes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#all-changes\">All changes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sections go BIG</h2>\n<p>In the drive to give our users more customization and organization options for their dashboards, we’ve added some new options to our Sections view that really lets us take big advantage of <a href=\"/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#resize-the-cards-on-your-dashboard\">resizable cards</a>. These powerful customization features can affect the <a href=\"/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#drag-and-drop-rearrangement-of-cards-and-sections\">predictability of where cards or sections will go</a>, especially when switching between desktop and mobile views, and we have found it works best with large cards. As always, the choice of how to use it is up to you.</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/2024-09/sections-before.png\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"Screenshot showing sections that are all 1 section wide, on the right showing a section that is 2 sections wide.\">\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/2024-09/sections-after.png\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"Screenshots showing a section that is 2 sections wide.\">\n</div>\n<h3>Wider sections</h3>\n<p>Sections can be expanded to span multiple sections. Now you can, for example, have your security camera feed span two sections or have a massive three-section wide map.</p>\n<p>Cards and sections will continue to follow the <a href=\"/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#drag-and-drop-rearrangement-of-cards-and-sections\">Z-Grid rules</a>, which can lead to blank spaces if the new wider sections don’t fit on a specific part of the screen. If you don’t like those blank spaces between sections, you can choose a <em>dense</em> layout. A dense section layout option will attempt to follow the Z-Grid rules, but will fill blank spaces whenever possible. This can affect the order and predictability of your sections, but will maximize screen real estate.</p>\n<p>When switching to smaller screens, these larger sections will revert to one section wide (if this causes issues for certain big cards, we would recommend using our device <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#control-visibility-of-cards\">visibility settings</a>).</p>\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-09/section-settings.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the section settings\">\n<h3>Full span cards</h3>\n<p>Larger sections mean larger cards. Instead of just stretching out the layout of a card, there is also a new option on cards to have them always use the full width of the section.</p>\n<h3>Badges</h3>\n<p>Talking about dashboards, the newly styled badges we <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#new-badges-for-your-dashboard\">introduced</a> in last release, are now more configurable.</p>\n<p>Instead of using display mode, you can decide for yourself what element you want to show. This allows you, for example, to hide the icon of an badge and only show the state of the device you want to show in your badge.</p>\n<h2>Tracking your untracked energy</h2>\n<p>In April, we introduced a <a href=\"/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#new-energy-graph-for-individual-devices\">new energy graph for individual devices</a> in our energy dashboard. This allows you to aggregate all your energy monitoring into one graph, giving you a quick way to see your house’s biggest energy-using devices. Big thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a>, the original creator of this graph, who has now updated it.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-09/untracked-energy.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the individual device energy graph\">\n<p>We can’t all have energy tracking for every device, and if you have whole-home energy tracking (like a smart meter or <a href=\"/home-energy-management\">something more DIY</a>) the updated graph will calculate the difference and show your home’s untracked usage. So hop onto your <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/energy/\">energy dashboard</a> and start to tackle your phantom energy load.</p>\n<h2>LLM agent options grow</h2>\n<p>When we added the ability to use <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#dipping-our-toes-in-the-world-of-ai-using-llms\">Large Language Models (LLMs)</a> in our Voice Assistant, it began with a limited number of conversation agents. These included the cloud-based  <a href=\"/components/openai_conversation/\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"/components/google_generative_ai_conversation/\">Google AI</a> integrations, along with the locally-run <a href=\"/integrations/ollama/\">Ollama</a> integration. All three can now control the devices in your home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Shulyaka\">@Shulyaka</a> has now added another cloud option with <a href=\"/integrations/anthropic\">Anthropic</a> - thanks again for giving us another option for experimenting with AI in Home Assistant. Setting it up can be a little different than other conversation agents, so take a look at the <a href=\"/integrations/anthropic\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>We have updated our <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports\">LLM leaderboard</a> to include Anthropic. Both Claude 3 Haiku and Claude 3 Sonnet score very high on our benchmarks and now rank among the top. Based on the results of the benchmark, we have set the cheaper Claude 3 Haiku as the default model for the Anthropic integration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter\">@allenporter</a> added the ability to configure the context window size of the <a href=\"/integrations/ollama\">Ollama</a> integration. The default size was increased, making it perform 20% better!</p>\n<h2>Aqara joins Works with Home Assistant</h2>\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-09-aqara-wwha/art.jpg\" alt=\"Aqara join Works via Matter with Home Assistant\">\n<p>We <a href=\"/blog/2024/09/03/aqara-joins-works-with-home-assistant/\">recently announced</a> that four Aqara devices are joining our <a href=\"https://partner.home-assistant.io/\">Works with Home Assistant</a> program.  What’s really exciting is that these are all Matter devices, and Aqara will be the first partner to use our “Works via Matter with Home Assistant” badge, giving some great options to use with Home Assistant’s amazing Matter integration.</p>\n<p>What’s more, this will be the first partner to join since <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/08/works-with-home-assistant-becomes-part-ohf/\">our recent update to the program</a>, meaning device-by-device certification that we tested ourselves. This makes it really easy to see what will give you the best experience in Home Assistant.</p>\n<h2>Open source compliance</h2>\n<p>We have put a lot of work into making sure that Home Assistant is truly open source, from top to bottom. This means ensuring that every library our integrations rely on uses the compliant license. We’re now at more than 2,800 integrations, so as you can imagine, this was not a small task. Working with code owners and library developers, we have painstakingly checked that every library is now using an <a href=\"https://opensource.org/license\">OSI-approved license</a>.</p>\n<p>This might seem like a small procedural thing, but it is critical to keep integrations and Home Assistant functional far into the future. If you’re not aware, libraries are what many device and service integrations rely on to function, by calling in additional protocol specific code that <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api_lib_index/\">purposely</a> sits outside of the Home Assistant project. If an individual or corporation can no longer maintain libraries, a proper open source license allows it to be picked up and continued by others.</p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

    "sanitized": "Home Assistant 2024.9! 🎉\nMany community members based in the northern hemisphere have taken advantage of the nicer weather to take a little time off. Home Assistant releases have continued to grow for some time, and this one might not be as gargantuan in size as previous releases, but it still packs some really cool features and announcements.\nThis release includes bigger sections, smarter energy monitoring, and a new LLM option. We’ve added five new integrations, along with one existing integration being added to the UI. On top of all that, we’ve announced a new Works with Home Assistant partner, and the culmination of a project to ensure our project is truly open source.\nWe hope you’ve been able to enjoy some time in, and away, from your smart home this month as well.\nEnjoy the release!\n\n\nSections go BIG\n\nWider sections\nFull span cards\nBadges\n\n\nTracking your untracked energy\nLLM agent options grow\nAqara joins Works with Home Assistant\nOpen source compliance\nIntegrations\n\nNew integrations\nNoteworthy improvements to existing integrations\nNow available to set up from the UI\nFarewell to the following\n\n\nPatch releases\n\n2024.9.1 - September 6\n2024.9.2 - September 16\n2024.9.3 - September 24\n\n\nNeed help? Join the community!\nBackward-incompatible changes\nAll changes\n\nSections go BIG\nIn the drive to give our users more customization and organization options for their dashboards, we’ve added some new options to our Sections view that really lets us take big advantage of resizable cards. These powerful customization features can affect the predictability of where cards or sections will go, especially when switching between desktop and mobile views, and we have found it works best with large cards. As always, the choice of how to use it is up to you.\n\n  \n  \n\nWider sections\nSections can be expanded to span multiple sections. Now you can, for example, have your security camera feed span two sections or have a massive three-section wide map.\nCards and sections will continue to follow the Z-Grid rules, which can lead to blank spaces if the new wider sections don’t fit on a specific part of the screen. If you don’t like those blank spaces between sections, you can choose a dense layout. A dense section layout option will attempt to follow the Z-Grid rules, but will fill blank spaces whenever possible. This can affect the order and predictability of your sections, but will maximize screen real estate.\nWhen switching to smaller screens, these larger sections will revert to one section wide (if this causes issues for certain big cards, we would recommend using our device visibility settings).\n\nFull span cards\nLarger sections mean larger cards. Instead of just stretching out the layout of a card, there is also a new option on cards to have them always use the full width of the section.\nBadges\nTalking about dashboards, the newly styled badges we introduced in last release, are now more configurable.\nInstead of using display mode, you can decide for yourself what element you want to show. This allows you, for example, to hide the icon of an badge and only show the state of the device you want to show in your badge.\nTracking your untracked energy\nIn April, we introduced a new energy graph for individual devices in our energy dashboard. This allows you to aggregate all your energy monitoring into one graph, giving you a quick way to see your house’s biggest energy-using devices. Big thanks to @karwosts, the original creator of this graph, who has now updated it.\n\nWe can’t all have energy tracking for every device, and if you have whole-home energy tracking (like a smart meter or something more DIY) the updated graph will calculate the difference and show your home’s untracked usage. So hop onto your energy dashboard and start to tackle your phantom energy load.\nLLM agent options grow\nWhen we added the ability to use Large Language Models (LLMs) in our Voice Assistant, it began with a limited number of conversation agents. These included the cloud-based  OpenAI and Google AI integrations, along with the locally-run Ollama integration. All three can now control the devices in your home.\n@Shulyaka has now added another cloud option with Anthropic - thanks again for giving us another option for experimenting with AI in Home Assistant. Setting it up can be a little different than other conversation agents, so take a look at the documentation.\nWe have updated our LLM leaderboard to include Anthropic. Both Claude 3 Haiku and Claude 3 Sonnet score very high on our benchmarks and now rank among the top. Based on the results of the benchmark, we have set the cheaper Claude 3 Haiku as the default model for the Anthropic integration.\n@allenporter added the ability to configure the context window size of the Ollama integration. The default size was increased, making it perform 20% better!\nAqara joins Works with Home Assistant\n\nWe recently announced that four Aqara devices are joining our Works with Home Assistant program.  What’s really exciting is that these are all Matter devices, and Aqara will be the first partner to use our “Works via Matter with Home Assistant” badge, giving some great options to use with Home Assistant’s amazing Matter integration.\nWhat’s more, this will be the first partner to join since our recent update to the program, meaning device-by-device certification that we tested ourselves. This makes it really easy to see what will give you the best experience in Home Assistant.\nOpen source compliance\nWe have put a lot of work into making sure that Home Assistant is truly open source, from top to bottom. This means ensuring that every library our integrations rely on uses the compliant license. We’re now at more than 2,800 integrations, so as you can imagine, this was not a small task. Working with code owners and library developers, we have painstakingly checked that every library is now using an OSI-approved license.\nThis might seem like a small procedural thing, but it is critical to keep integrations and Home Assistant functional far into the future. If you’re not aware, libraries are what many device and service integrations rely on to function, by calling in additional protocol specific code that purposely sits outside of the Home Assistant project. If an individual or corporation can no longer maintain libraries, a proper open source license allows it to be picked up and continued by others.\nIntegrations\nThanks to our community for keeping pace with the new integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more]\nand improvements to existing ones! You’re all awesome 🥰\nNew integrations\nWe welcome the following new integrations in this release:\n\nAnthropic Conversation, added by @Shulyaka\nUse AI by Anthropic, like the Claude 3.5 Sonnet as a conversation agent in Home Assistant.\nNice G.O., added by @IceBotYT\nIntegrate with compatible garage door and gate openers from the Nice.\nFujitsu FGLair, added by @crevetor\nFujitsu HVAC devices that use the Ayla IoT platform (controlled with the FGLair app).\nSMLIGHT, added by @tl-sl\nManage SMLIGHT SLZB-06 adaptors from Home Assistant.\nRoth Touchline SL, added by @jnsgruk\nA new integration for the Roth Touchline SL underfloor heating system.\nYale, added by @bdraco\nThe Yale Home brand now has its own integration and will no longer be using the August integration. If you use a Yale Home device with the August integration, you should migrate to the new Yale integration.\n\nThis release also has a new virtual integration. Virtual integrations\nare stubs that are handled by other (existing) integrations to help with\ndiscoverability. These ones are new:\n\nArtSound, provided by LinkPlay, added by @dukeofphilberg\n\nNoteworthy improvements to existing integrations\nIt is not just new integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] that have been added; existing\nintegrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy\nchanges to existing integrations:\n\nThe Mosquitto MQTT broker add-on can now be installed and started automatically when you setup MQTT. Great work @jbouwh!\n@allenporter added event entities to the Nest integration.\n@bdraco made it easier to add battery operated Shelly devices, you no longer have to manually set an outbound WebSocket configuration.\nMotionBlinds now has a button for your favorite position.

Thanks @andrew-codechimp!\n\nNow available to set up from the UI\nWhile most integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] can be set up directly from the Home Assistant\nuser interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving\nmore integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone\nto set up and use.\nYou can now add a number template helper from the UI Thanks @dougiteixeira!\nFarewell to the following\nThe following integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] are also no longer available as\nof this release:\n\nAsterisk Call Detail Records and Asterisk Voicemail. Previously\ndeprecated and now removed.

These\npatch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch every\nweek (around Friday).\n2024.9.1 - September 6\n\nFix BTHome validate triggers for device with multiple buttons (@thecode - #125183)\nImprove play media support in LinkPlay (@silamon - #125205)\nRevert #122676 Yamaha discovery (@joostlek - #125216)\nFix blocking call in yale_smart_alarm (@gjohansson-ST - #125255)\nDon’t show input panel if default code provided in envisalink (@gjohansson-ST - #125256)\nIncrease AquaCell timeout and handle timeout exception properly (@Jordi1990 - #125263)\nBump aiorussound to 3.0.4 (@noahhusby - #125285)\nAdd follower to the PlayingMode enum (@silamon - #125294)\nDon’t allow templating min, max, step in config entry template number (@emontnemery - #125342)\nFix for Hue sending effect None at turn_on command while no effect is active (@marcelveldt - #125377)\nLyric: fixed missed snake case conversions (@dalinicus - #125382)\nBump pysmlight to 0.0.14 (@tl-sl - #125387)\nBump pypck to 0.7.22 (@alengwenus - #125389)\nIncrease coordinator update_interval for fyta (@dontinelli - #125393)\nFix controlling AC temperature in airtouch5 (@danzel - #125394)\nBump sfrbox-api to 0.0.10 (@AlexT59 - #125405)\nImprove handling of old firmware versions (@tl-sl - #125406)\nSet min_power similar to max_power to support all inverters from apsystems (@mawoka-myblock - #124247)\nUpdate frontend to 20240906.0 (@piitaya - #125409)\nBump pyatv to 0.15.1 (@postlund - #125412)\n\n2024.9.2 - September 16\n\nFix Lyric climate Auto mode (@kristof-mattei - #123490)\nUse default voice id as fallback in get_tts_audio (@sorgfresser - #123624)\nFix Schlage removed locks (@dknowles2 - #123627)\nFix mired range in blebox color temp mode lights (@swistakm - #124258)\nUpdate diagnostics for BSBLan (@liudger - #124508)\nFix renault plug state (@tmenguy - #125421)\nBump yalexs to 8.6.4 (@bdraco - #125442)\nBump aiolifx and aiolifx-themes to support more than 82 zones (@Djelibeybi - #125487)\nFix yale_smart_alarm on missing key (@gjohansson-ST - #125508)\nFIx Sonos announce regression issue (@PeteRager - #125515)\nUpdate frontend to 20240909.1 (@piitaya - #125610)\nUpdate tplink config to include aes keys (@sdb9696 - #125685)\nBump tplink python-kasa lib to 0.7.3 (@sdb9696 - #125686)\nFix incomfort invalid setpoint if override is reported as 0.0 (@jbouwh - #125694)\nBump to python-nest-sdm to 5.0.1 (@jonnynch - #125706)\nRemove unused keys from the ZHA config schema (@puddly - #125710)\nBump sfrbox-api to 0.0.11 (@epenet - #125732)\nUpdate knx-frontend to 2024.9.10.221729 (@farmio - #125734)\nBump russound to 0.2.0 (@akrabi - #125743)\nFix favorite position missing for Motion Blinds TDBU devices (@starkillerOG - #125750)\nAdd missing Zigbee/Thread firmware config flow translations (@puddly - #125782)\nBump lmcloud to 1.2.3 (@zweckj - #125801)\nBump ZHA to 0.0.33 (@puddly - #125914)\nBump motionblinds to 0.6.25 (@starkillerOG - #125957)\nBump govee light local to 1.5.2 (@Galorhallen - #125968)\nBump aiorussound to 3.0.5 (@noahhusby - #125975)\nAbort zeroconf flow on connect error during discovery (@tl-sl - #125980)\nPin pyasn1 until fixed (@hunterjm - #125712)\n\n2024.9.3 - September 24\n\nFix wall connector state in Teslemetry (@Bre77 - #124149)\nFix set brightness for Netatmo lights (@cgtobi - #126075)\nUpdate Aseko to support new API (@milanmeu - #126133)\nFix qbittorrent error when torrent count is 0 (@DAcodedBEAT - #126146)\nPrevent blocking event loop in ps4 (@jpbede - #126151)\nBroaden scope of ConfigEntryNotReady in Mealie (@andrew-codechimp - #126208)\nFix tibber fails if power production is enabled but no power is produced (@nohn - #126209)\nBump pydaikin to 2.13.7 (@fredrike - #126219)\nFix Matter climate platform attributes when dedicated OnOff attribute is off (@marcelveldt - #126286)\nFix loading KNX UI entities with entity category set (@farmio - #126290)\nBump airgradient to 0.9.0 (@joostlek - #126319)\nFix next change (scheduler) sensors in AVM FRITZ!SmartHome (@mib1185 - #126363)\nBump python-holidays to 0.57 (@gjohansson-ST - #126367)\nFix surepetcare token update (@frei-style - #126385)\nFix due date calculation for future dailies in Habitica integration (@tr4nt0r - #126403)\nBump pydrawise to 2024.9.0 (@dknowles2 - #126431)\nAdd support for new JVC Projector auth method (@SteveEasley - #126453)\nFix blocking call in Bang & Olufsen API client initialization (@mj23000 - #126456)\nBump mozart_api to 3.4.1.8.8 (@mj23000 - #126334)\n\nNeed help?

Unfortunately, sometimes,\nit is inevitable.\nWe always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as\npossible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:\n\n  \n    \n      Recorder database upgrade notice\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThis notice applies only if you use the recorder integration with a MySQL or\nPostgreSQL database. If you are using the default SQLite database,\nyou can ignore it.\nLast release included a database upgrade/migration that increases the size of\nthe number we can store for the identifier fields.\nNot all migrations were successful despite being marked as successful. This\nrelease will do the migration again, but will catch unsuccessful migrations.\nThis can cause the database upgrade to take longer than usual, depending on\nthe size of your database.\nPlease be patient and let the upgrade process finish. Do not interrupt the\nupgrade process, as this can lead to a corrupted database.\n(@emontnemery - #123973) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Asterisk Call Detail Records\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nAsterisk Call Detail Records has been deprecated in 2024.3.0 and has now been removed.\nIt was using a deprecated mailbox feature that is no longer available.\n(@joostlek - #123180)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Asterisk Voicemail\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nAsterisk Voicemail has been deprecated in 2024.3.0 and has now been removed.\nIt was using a deprecated mailbox feature that is no longer available.\n(@joostlek - #123180)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      August\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nIf you are using a Yale Home device with the August integration, you should migrate to the new Yale integration.\nYale Home devices will soon stop working with the August integration.\n(@bdraco - #124895) (august documentation - yale documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Ecovacs\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThe YAML configuration for the Ecovacs integration was removed.

This follows HACS being added as an <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a> collaboration partner, recognizing its important role in Home Assistant’s open ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Just note, HACS is an advanced tool that can add custom code to your Home Assistant install, which can cause issues on your Home Assistant system. If you are a beginner or prioritize stability above all else, <a href=\"#how-to-install\">HACS might not be for you</a>.</p>\n<h2>Jump to sections <!-- omit from toc --></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#hacs-reaches-v20\">HACS reaches v2.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-hacs\">What is HACS?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#why-use-hacs\">Why use HACS?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#a-brief-history-of-hacs\">A Brief History of HACS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-install\">How to install</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Want to skip the blog and just start playing with HACS 2.0?</strong></em> Just remember to proceed with caution and do not skip the backup step before you <a href=\"#how-to-install\">install</a>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>HACS reaches v2.0</h2>\n<p>This is one of the biggest updates yet for HACS, but if you’re not sure what HACS is or why you might consider using it, check out our <a href=\"#what-is-hacs\">explainer below</a>.</p>\n<h3>New frontend <!-- omit from toc --></h3>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-08-hacs2/frontend.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"HACS frontend looks like data tables\">\n<p>HACS 2.0 <a href=\"https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/repositories/dashboard/\">main dashboard</a> has taken cues from Home Assistant, and now closely matches the native look and functionality of the data tables you find on the entities or automation pages. This includes the options to filter, group, sort, and search.</p>\n<h3>Faster downloads <!-- omit from toc --></h3>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-08-hacs2/downloads.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"HDownload window going very fast\">\n<p>Previously, HACS 100% relied on GitHub to retrieve information, from file locations to the number of stars, so we needed to limit the API (as there are a lot of HACS users). To speed things up, we’ve created a <a href=\"https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/data_sources/\">remote dataset</a> stored in Cloudflare R2 buckets, which are updated at regular intervals.  Files are still downloaded from GitHub and their API is still contacted, but it will see drastically fewer calls, and the speed improvement is massive. Behind the scenes, this was a big piece of work, which has ongoing costs, and shows the kind of support the Open Home Foundation can provide to a community-driven project like HACS.</p>\n<h3>Update and repair <!-- omit from toc --></h3>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-08-hacs2/updates-repairs.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"update all your Home Assistant from the same place\">\n<p>No more visiting the HACS page every day to check for updates. They’ll now appear in the same places system and add-on <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/updates/\">updates</a> appear in the native Home Assistant format. Also, once they’re finished updating, they will give you suggested repairs (for instance, reloading the dashboards or rebooting Home Assistant).</p>\n<h3>Other improvements <!-- omit from toc --></h3>\n<p>We have also renamed things to help them make more sense, including changing “category” to “type”, and “Lovelace” to “dashboard” (Lovelace needs to make room for <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#what-is-project-grace\">Grace</a>). We’re also including Template management, which utilizes the new <a href=\"https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/publish/template/\">template type</a> to enhance your Jinja templates.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-note\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>\n  <p class=\"alert-content\">\n<p><strong>Breaking changes</strong> - There have been some breaking changes, such as removing the YAML configuration, no longer including the NetDaemon type, and moving <a href=\"https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/entities/switch/\">beta selection to a switch entity</a>. Many of the changes are more likely to affect those sharing their code via HACS, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/hacs/integration/releases/tag/2.0.0\">release notes for the full list</a>.</p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<h2>What is HACS?</h2>\n<p>Home Assistant is built around choice, and HACS is the epitome of this, giving you access to hundreds of community-made integrations, cards, themes, and more. HACS isn’t actually <em>a hack</em>, as Home Assistant has always allowed you to add custom integrations and UI elements - HACS just adds a streamlined interface to find, install, and update these.</p>\n<p>HACS stands for <em>Home Assistant Community Store</em>, and despite the name it doesn’t sell anything - it’s all free and open-source. HACS is there for people in the community who write custom code to address something they think is missing from Home Assistant. It allows them to easily share this code with the community unrestricted via submitting their GitHub repository to HACS. This means these are maintained by the community members that upload them, not HACS or Home Assistant. If you want to learn more about what you’re installing, or report issues, there is always a link to the original code.  </p>\n<p>Just to clear up the biggest misconception about HACS, <strong>it does not install add-ons</strong>. Home Assistant OS natively has its own <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_store/\">built-in store for Home Assistant Add-ons</a>. Add-ons run alongside Home Assistant, while HACS installs custom code that can run in Home Assistant (which has implications for system stability, more on that below).</p>\n<h2>Why use HACS?</h2>\n<p><strong>More integrations</strong> - Not every device and service is supported by Home Assistant out-of-the-box, and HACS helps fill the gaps. There are hundreds of integrations on HACS, some are there because the authors didn’t have the time to meet Home Assistant’s requirements, while others are doing something not allowed by Home Assistant, like web scraping (which is sometimes the only way, but <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/issues/252\">not a good idea</a>). Just be aware that these decisions can come at the expense of stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced integrations</strong> - Some HACS integrations are more complex and advanced versions of their Core counterparts, while other integrations combine multiple sensors to provide new data points. Some of these “integrations” even give Home Assistant advanced new features and settings. It also allows for rapid development as it allows updates outside the Home Assistant refresh cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Cards and Themes</strong> - There are some amazing cards, UIs, and themes being built by community developers and designers - BTW if you’re one, <a href=\"/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/#process-how-can-we-work-together\">our frontend team needs your help</a>. HACS has made the installation and updating of these designs very simple and quick.</p>\n<p><strong>Scripts and Templates</strong> - This is the easiest way to share scripts and templates, while also adding the ability to push new improvements to users via updates.</p>\n<h2>A Brief History of HACS</h2>\n<p>HACS started in 2019 as my (<a href=\"https://github.com/ludeeus\">Joakim Sørensen</a> ) third attempt to build a community store. It started small and quickly became the de facto standard, with so many talented community creators submitting their projects. The Home Assistant team was supportive from day one, and even as HACS gained hundreds of thousands of downloads, we all agreed it should remain an optional addition to Home Assistant. Giving users the choice to add new features to Home Assistant at the cost of stability.</p>\n<p>I joined <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Nabu Casa</a> in 2020, partly due to the work I did on HACS, but I was hired to work on Home Assistant more generally, not to work on HACS. Incidentally, I’m not the only developer working at Nabu Casa who got their start on HACS: <a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya\">Paul Bottein</a>  on the frontend team built <a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom\">Mushroom Cards</a>, and  <a href=\"https://github.com/marcelveldt\">Marcel van der Veldt</a> who currently supports Matter development built <a href=\"https://music-assistant.io/\">Music Assistant</a>.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I continued to work on HACS in my spare time, but there were always aspects of the original version that limited its ability to grow. Recently, the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a> reached out to make HACS a collaboration partner, and provided development support. Numerous people were brought in to support, from across Nabu Casa and the community, leading to the large list of improvements you see today.</p>\n<p>Just before we released this big update, it passed 5,000 stars on GitHub! It’s the projects on HACS that make it what it is today, and I’d like to sincerely thank everyone who continues to contribute their code onto the store.</p>\n<h2>How to install</h2>\n<div class=\"alert alert-note\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>\n  <p class=\"alert-content\">\n<p><strong>Proceed with caution</strong> - HACS is not for everyone.  If you’re a Home Assistant beginner or are looking for the most stable experience in your smart home, HACS is probably not for you. These are community-made projects that do not receive the same rigorous reviews required of projects submitted to Home Assistant. There may be projects that don’t work or, even worse, break your system. Unlike add-ons that run separately and alongside Home Assistant, HACS projects run their code directly in Home Assistant, which increases the chances of crashing or harming your system. Before using HACS, always make a <a href=\"https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/data/#creating-a-backup\">backup of your system</a> and download that backup to another device.</p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>HACS should work on any up-to-date version of Home Assistant, it even runs on core installations. It also requires a GitHub account. If you already have HACS 1.X installed, perform a backup, go into HACS and then click the update button for HACS (note: if you update, there is no downgrading).</p>\n<p>If you’re a Home Assistant OS user here is the installation method (If you’re not using our OS, <a href=\"https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/#to-download-hacs-core\">visit this page</a>),</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make a <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/backup/\">backup of your system</a> and download it to another device for safekeeping.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Install the addon: Using <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhacs%2Faddons&amp;addon=cb646a50_get\">this link</a>, add the HACS add-on repository, and install the add-on it links to, <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhacs%2Faddons&amp;addon=cb646a50_get\"><img src=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg\" alt=\"Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of an add-on.\" /></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the add-on (no need to “start on boot”, you should only need to run this once).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to the add-on’s “Log” and follow the instructions given there.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once finished, reboot Home Assistant and navigate to the <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/devices/\">devices page</a>. Add the integration HACS, and follow the instructions to link it with your GitHub account.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>It’s installed, now what?</strong></em> Start downloading some custom integrations and UI elements. There are a lot of great community resources listing the best custom <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/c/projects/custom-integrations/47?ascending=false&amp;order=views\">integrations</a>, <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/c/projects/frontend/34?ascending=false&amp;order=views\">cards</a>, <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/c/projects/themes/29/l/top\">themes</a>, and more.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion <!-- omit from toc --></h2>\n<p>There are too many people to thank in this blog who have helped the development of HACS over the years.  Thanks for submitting your projects, reporting issues, fixing code, and just using this funny little side project.

    "sanitized": "Art by Clelia Rella\nTL;DR:  HACS 2.0 is a big step forward, adding an easier install method, faster updates, a new UI, and proper Home Assistant update/repair notifications.\nHome Assistant’s Community Store, HACS, has now hit v2.0, gaining some big improvements that continue to make it the best way to find, install, and update awesome community-made integrations and UI elements. This follows HACS being added as an Open Home Foundation collaboration partner, recognizing its important role in Home Assistant’s open ecosystem.\nJust note, HACS is an advanced tool that can add custom code to your Home Assistant install, which can cause issues on your Home Assistant system. If you are a beginner or prioritize stability above all else, HACS might not be for you.\nJump to sections \n\nHACS reaches v2.0\nWhat is HACS?\nWhy use HACS?\nA Brief History of HACS\nHow to install\n\nWant to skip the blog and just start playing with HACS 2.0? Just remember to proceed with caution and do not skip the backup step before you install.\n\nHACS reaches v2.0\nThis is one of the biggest updates yet for HACS, but if you’re not sure what HACS is or why you might consider using it, check out our explainer below.\nNew frontend \n\nHACS 2.0 main dashboard has taken cues from Home Assistant, and now closely matches the native look and functionality of the data tables you find on the entities or automation pages. This includes the options to filter, group, sort, and search.\nFaster downloads \n\nPreviously, HACS 100% relied on GitHub to retrieve information, from file locations to the number of stars, so we needed to limit the API (as there are a lot of HACS users). To speed things up, we’ve created a remote dataset stored in Cloudflare R2 buckets, which are updated at regular intervals.  Files are still downloaded from GitHub and their API is still contacted, but it will see drastically fewer calls, and the speed improvement is massive. Behind the scenes, this was a big piece of work, which has ongoing costs, and shows the kind of support the Open Home Foundation can provide to a community-driven project like HACS.\nUpdate and repair \n\nNo more visiting the HACS page every day to check for updates. They’ll now appear in the same places system and add-on updates appear in the native Home Assistant format. Also, once they’re finished updating, they will give you suggested repairs (for instance, reloading the dashboards or rebooting Home Assistant).\nOther improvements \nWe have also renamed things to help them make more sense, including changing “category” to “type”, and “Lovelace” to “dashboard” (Lovelace needs to make room for Grace). We’re also including Template management, which utilizes the new template type to enhance your Jinja templates.\n\n   Note\n  \nBreaking changes - There have been some breaking changes, such as removing the YAML configuration, no longer including the NetDaemon type, and moving beta selection to a switch entity. Many of the changes are more likely to affect those sharing their code via HACS, check the release notes for the full list.\n  \n\nWhat is HACS?\nHome Assistant is built around choice, and HACS is the epitome of this, giving you access to hundreds of community-made integrations, cards, themes, and more. HACS isn’t actually a hack, as Home Assistant has always allowed you to add custom integrations and UI elements - HACS just adds a streamlined interface to find, install, and update these.\nHACS stands for Home Assistant Community Store, and despite the name it doesn’t sell anything - it’s all free and open-source. HACS is there for people in the community who write custom code to address something they think is missing from Home Assistant. It allows them to easily share this code with the community unrestricted via submitting their GitHub repository to HACS. This means these are maintained by the community members that upload them, not HACS or Home Assistant. If you want to learn more about what you’re installing, or report issues, there is always a link to the original code.  \nJust to clear up the biggest misconception about HACS, it does not install add-ons. Home Assistant OS natively has its own built-in store for Home Assistant Add-ons. Add-ons run alongside Home Assistant, while HACS installs custom code that can run in Home Assistant (which has implications for system stability, more on that below).\nWhy use HACS?\nMore integrations - Not every device and service is supported by Home Assistant out-of-the-box, and HACS helps fill the gaps. There are hundreds of integrations on HACS, some are there because the authors didn’t have the time to meet Home Assistant’s requirements, while others are doing something not allowed by Home Assistant, like web scraping (which is sometimes the only way, but not a good idea). Just be aware that these decisions can come at the expense of stability.\nAdvanced integrations - Some HACS integrations are more complex and advanced versions of their Core counterparts, while other integrations combine multiple sensors to provide new data points. Some of these “integrations” even give Home Assistant advanced new features and settings. It also allows for rapid development as it allows updates outside the Home Assistant refresh cycle.\nCards and Themes - There are some amazing cards, UIs, and themes being built by community developers and designers - BTW if you’re one, our frontend team needs your help. HACS has made the installation and updating of these designs very simple and quick.\nScripts and Templates - This is the easiest way to share scripts and templates, while also adding the ability to push new improvements to users via updates.\nA Brief History of HACS\nHACS started in 2019 as my (Joakim Sørensen ) third attempt to build a community store. It started small and quickly became the de facto standard, with so many talented community creators submitting their projects. The Home Assistant team was supportive from day one, and even as HACS gained hundreds of thousands of downloads, we all agreed it should remain an optional addition to Home Assistant. Giving users the choice to add new features to Home Assistant at the cost of stability.\nI joined Nabu Casa in 2020, partly due to the work I did on HACS, but I was hired to work on Home Assistant more generally, not to work on HACS. Incidentally, I’m not the only developer working at Nabu Casa who got their start on HACS: Paul Bottein  on the frontend team built Mushroom Cards, and  Marcel van der Veldt who currently supports Matter development built Music Assistant.\nOver the years, I continued to work on HACS in my spare time, but there were always aspects of the original version that limited its ability to grow. Recently, the Open Home Foundation reached out to make HACS a collaboration partner, and provided development support. Numerous people were brought in to support, from across Nabu Casa and the community, leading to the large list of improvements you see today.\nJust before we released this big update, it passed 5,000 stars on GitHub! It’s the projects on HACS that make it what it is today, and I’d like to sincerely thank everyone who continues to contribute their code onto the store.\nHow to install\n\n   Note\n  \nProceed with caution - HACS is not for everyone.  If you’re a Home Assistant beginner or are looking for the most stable experience in your smart home, HACS is probably not for you. These are community-made projects that do not receive the same rigorous reviews required of projects submitted to Home Assistant. There may be projects that don’t work or, even worse, break your system. Unlike add-ons that run separately and alongside Home Assistant, HACS projects run their code directly in Home Assistant, which increases the chances of crashing or harming your system. Before using HACS, always make a backup of your system and download that backup to another device.\n  \n\nHACS should work on any up-to-date version of Home Assistant, it even runs on core installations. It also requires a GitHub account. If you already have HACS 1.X installed, perform a backup, go into HACS and then click the update button for HACS (note: if you update, there is no downgrading).\nIf you’re a Home Assistant OS user here is the installation method (If you’re not using our OS, visit this page),\n\n\nMake a backup of your system and download it to another device for safekeeping.\n\n\nInstall the addon: Using this link, add the HACS add-on repository, and install the add-on it links to, \n\n\nStart the add-on (no need to “start on boot”, you should only need to run this once).\n\n\nNavigate to the add-on’s “Log” and follow the instructions given there.\n\n\nOnce finished, reboot Home Assistant and navigate to the devices page. Add the integration HACS, and follow the instructions to link it with your GitHub account.\n\n\nIt’s installed, now what? Start downloading some custom integrations and UI elements. There are a lot of great community resources listing the best custom integrations, cards, themes, and more.\nConclusion \nThere are too many people to thank in this blog who have helped the development of HACS over the years.  Thanks for submitting your projects, reporting issues, fixing code, and just using this funny little side project. Most important to this all, thanks to Home Assistant Cloud subscribers. They made this update possible, not only do they pay my salary, but they also fund the Open Home Foundation, whose support was critical."

The new badges are designed to match the design of the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom\">Mushroom</a> chip cards, and are meant to sit at the top of a dashboard view,\nproviding a summary of the most important information that you need to know\nat a glance.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/new-badges.png\" alt=\"New badges sitting on top of a dashboard view!\">\n<p>These new badges match the functionality of the previous design but are\nnow even more feature-rich. Of course, they are fully configurable from the UI,\nallowing you to tweak them to your needs. You can specify whether the icon,\nname, and/or state will be visible, and you can configure the contents within\neach of them.</p>\n<p>Everything can, of course, be dragged and dropped in the order you like 😎</p>\n<p>Not just that, the new badges also come with visibility options, the same\nas we have <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#control-visibility-of-cards\">introduced for cards in Home Assistant 2024.6</a>.\nThis means you can show or hide them based on who is viewing the dashboard, what\nscreen size it is displayed within, whether an entity is in a certain state,\nand more.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/badges-add-visibility.png\" alt=\"Screenshots; left showing the add badge dialog wich include the custom mushroom template badge, on the right shows the visibility tab and options badges now have.\">\n<p>The best news of all? The new badges work across both the new sections view and\nthe old masonry view! 🎉 Heck!, we even have support for custom badges, like the\ncustom template one released by the <a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom\">Mushroom</a> project 🍄.</p>\n<p>If you have existing old-style badges today, don’t worry! They will be\nautomatically converted to the new badges when you upgrade to this release.</p>\n<h3>Optimized information density for the Sections view</h3>\n<p>For this release, we have also fine-tuned the design grid for our\n<a href=\"/dashboards/sections/\">experimental Sections view</a>.</p>\n<p>The height of each row has been reduced, allowing more information to be\ndisplayed on the screen. Hours of pixel pushing have also reduced the gap\nbetween the <a href=\"/dashboards/tile/\">Tile card</a> contents and its\n<a href=\"/dashboards/features/\">features</a>, resulting in a cleaner and more\nuniform appearance.</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/optimized-information-density.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the difference between the previous and current release.\">\nThe 2024.7 release on the left and this 2024.8 release on the right.\n</p>\n<p>If you have been experimenting with sections and have resized some of your\ncards, you may need to readjust the sizes to accommodate these changes.</p>\n<h2>Goodbye service calls, hello actions 👋</h2>\n<p>This release marks an important milestone in the evolution of Home Assistant:\nwe are saying goodbye to <strong>service calls</strong> and hello to <strong>actions</strong>!</p>\n<p>If you are a long-time user of Home Assistant reading this now: don’t be alarmed\nby this change, nothing breaks with this, and everything will continue to work\njust as it did before.</p>\n<p>In the 2024.1 release, we <a href=\"/2024/01/03/release-20241/#unified-actions\">unified the actions</a>\nin the Home Assistant <span class='terminology'>automation<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Automations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> &amp; script editors. The goal of\nthat change was to make our automation editor easier for newer users to\nunderstand by removing the “Service call” layer and terminology.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-01/add-action-search.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new add action dialog utilizing the search function to find whatever you need.\">\n<p>The above screenshot shows the UI that has been in use since the <a href=\"/2024/01/03/release-20241/\">January release</a>,\nand was very well received in general. However, the underlying terminology\nin our documentation and all other places in Home Assistant still used the\n“service call” terminology.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the term “services” in Home Assistant is overloaded and ambiguous.\nIt is used for both the services you can call in Home Assistant and services you\nmight integrate with, like weather or music services. In the latter case, we\nare talking about integrating with a service provided by a program or website,\nwhich is referenced in our Settings page as <strong>Devices &amp; services</strong>. 😵‍💫</p>\n<p>To make things clearer, we are now changing the terminology around\n<em>service calls</em> in Home Assistant from “services” to “actions” <strong>everywhere</strong>.</p>\n<p>Every occurrence in the documentation, the UI, the code, and everywhere else\nin Home Assistant, has been replaced with “action”. Unlike the previous services\nwhich were “called”, actions are “performed”.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/actions-developers-tools.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the developers tools, which also renamed all occurances of services to actions.\">\n<div class=\"alert alert-important\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:message-alert-outline'></iconify-icon> Important</p>\n  <p class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>If you write automations in YAML, you will notice that the <code>service</code> key\nin your actions is now called <code>action</code>. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"language-yaml highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-lang=\"yaml\"><span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">action</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">light.turn_on</span>\n  <span class=\"na\">target</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">area</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">living_room</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Existing UI-managed automations will be automatically converted the next time they\nare edited and saved. If you write automation in YAML, you can\nuse either <code>action</code> or <code>service</code>, as this change is fully backward compatible,\nbut we recommend using <code>action</code> from now on.</p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Sort data tables by created or last modified</h2>\n<p>You’ve added a new integration, a new device, or maybe just updated\nHome Assistant and wondering what new entities or devices you have available?</p>\n<p>This release will help you with that. Home Assistant now tracks when entities\nand devices, and many other things were created or last modified. If these are\nshown in a table, it means you can now sort them by the date they were created\nor last modified; helping you find those recently added or modified items.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/data-tables-created-modified-columns-sorting.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new created and modified columns of the entities table, allowing one to sort on these new values.\">\n<p>The created and modified columns are hidden by default, but you can make them\nvisible by clicking the <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:cog' title='Cog'></iconify-icon> icon at the top right of the\ntable. Sorting is always available, regardless of the columns’ visibility.</p>\n<p>You might notice that most entities and devices do not have this created or\nmodified data populated yet. Well this data has only started being recorded in\nthis release, and cannot be applied retroactively, but going forward it should\nonly get more useful.</p>\n<h2>Control Home Assistant using AI with Ollama</h2>\n<p>In the 2024.6 release, we introduced the ability to use the <a href=\"/integrations/openai_conversation\">OpenAI</a> and\n<a href=\"/integrations/google_generative_ai_conversation/\">GoogleAI</a> <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> to <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#dipping-our-toes-in-the-world-of-ai-using-llms\">control your home using Large Language Models</a>\n(LLMs). Many of you requested this to work with a local hosted LLM as well.</p>\n<p>Today we are happy to announce that Home Assistant now supports\ncontrol via local LLMs too!</p>\n<p>This is achieved thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/Shulyaka\">@Shulyaka</a> adding support for the brand new tools\nAPI in Ollama. The performance of the local models has been fine tuned by\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AllenPorter\">@AllenPorter</a>.</p>\n<p>Allen created a new <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports#assist-mini\">LLM benchmark suite</a> that is more balanced, less focused\non edge cases, and uses fewer exposed entities. We scored the different models\nwith this new benchmark, and the cloud-based models scored 98%, but local LLMs\ndid not do nearly as well.</p>\n<p>Through prompt tuning and fixes included in this release, we have gotten local\nLLMs to score a reasonable 84%. We will continue to test new models while\nimproving our prompts and tools to achieve a higher score.</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/ollama-model-performance.png\" alt=\"Picture showing the results of the LLM benchmark suite ran against different models.\">\nOverview of performance of Ollama running different local models ran against the <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports#assist-mini\">LLM benchmark suite</a>.\n</p>\n<p>If you want to experiment with local LLMs using Home Assistant, we currently\nrecommend using the Llama 3.1 8B model and exposing fewer than 25 entities. Note\nthat smaller models are more likely to make mistakes.</p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

Well… basically: <em><strong>nothing</strong></em>! And this sounds odd,\nbut that is a good thing!</p>\n<p>The whole integration has been split into a separate codebase, making it\neasier to maintain and improve. This is a huge step forward for the integration,\nand took months of work to get done.</p>\n<p>You will not notice anything different right now, but this change will make the\nintegration easier to maintain and improve in the future, including allowing\ncode contributors to contribute more easily.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the dedication and the huge amounts of hard work on this integration\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dmulcahey\">@dmulcahey</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/puddly\">@puddly</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/TheJulianJES\">@TheJulianJES</a>! 🥰</p>\n<h2>Matter updates</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of updates for the Matter integration this release, while we\nare working hard to get the integration ready for official Matter certification.</p>\n<p>The Matter integration can now provide update entities. If your Matter device\nhas a firmware update available, Home Assistant will now be able to inform you\nabout it and update the device for you. 🎉</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/matter-updates.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing an firmware update for an Matter device being able and can be installed straight from the Home Assistant UI.\"></p>\n<p>This update feature is available for all Matter devices, where manufacturers\nprovide firmware updates via the official Matter update channels. Not many\nmanufacturers are involved in delivering these updates yet, but this is a great\nstep forward, and we hope many manufacturers using Matter will follow this\nexample.</p>\n<p>Event entities provided by the Matter integration have been improved. They\nwill now provide more event types, allowing you to react to things like single\npress or double press events with ease.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://github.com/jvmahon\">@jvmahon</a> contributed support for select entities to the Matter\nintegration. This is used to select modes if your Matter device supports them,\nsuch as laundry, oven, or dishwasher modes.</p>\n<p>These last two features, are amazing improvements to the Matter integration,\nbut they are mainly a highlight. Many Matter device types have seen improvements,\nincluding more (configuration) entities and other improvements.</p>\n<h2>KNX can now be managed via the UI</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/integrations/knx\">KNX integration</a> introduces the ability to manage entities directly from the\nUI. 🎉</p>\n<p>If you have an ETS project file, configuring your devices is now more\nintuitive; you can easily select an actuator from the side panel and drag and\ndrop its assigned group addresses into the configuration. Alternatively,\naddresses can be found by name or number using dropdown menus.</p>\n<p>Create, update, and delete KNX switch and light entities directly from the KNX\npanel without touching any YAML. 😎</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/knx-panel-for-creating-entities.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the KNX panel that allows to create entities right from the UI.\"></p>\n<p>More improvements have been made under the hood. One of the most notable changes\nis the support for a broader range of Data Point Type (DPT) definitions. These\ncan be used directly within actions and triggers and inspected\nin the KNX GroupMonitor.</p>\n<p>Thank you for working so hard on this one <a href=\"https://github.com/farmio\">@farmio</a>; this is awesome! 🥰</p>\n<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>\n<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other\nnoteworthy changes this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are proud of our <a href=\"https://openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, so we will now show its pretty\nlogo on the Home Assistant loading and information screens. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/balloob\">@balloob</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#timers-are-here\">Timer support</a> using <a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist</a> for mobile devices. This means you can now\ncontrol timers from your mobile device or tablet.

Cool!</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/dashboards/picture-elements/\">picture elements card</a> can now be fully managed in the UI using a\nbrand-new visual editor. Fantastic work there <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a>!</li>\n<li>Home Assistant will now raise a repair issue if a script can’t be set up\n(for example, because of YAML syntax errors). Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/emontnemery\">@emontnemery</a>!</li>\n<li>If Home Assistant finds an integration set up that has been removed\n(like when you remove a custom integration), it will now raise a repair issue\nto help you clean up anything left behind. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/joostlek\">@joostlek</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"/integrations/group\">Group</a> now has support for grouping two new entity types. <a href=\"https://github.com/joostlek\">@joostlek</a> added\nsupport for grouping <a href=\"/integrations/notify\">notify</a> entities, and <a href=\"https://github.com/frenck\">@frenck</a> added support for grouping\n<a href=\"/integrations/button\">button</a> entities. Nice!</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/integrations/generic_thermostat\">Generic Thermostat</a> and <a href=\"/integrations/generic_hygrostat\">Hygrostat</a> helpers will now be linked to the\ndevice that provided the actuator entity, thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/dougiteixeira\">@dougiteixeira</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gjohansson-ST\">@gjohansson-ST</a> did the same, he added a link to the <a href=\"/integrations/history_stats\">History stats</a> helper\nto the device that provided the sensor entity.</li>\n<li>You can now set up <a href=\"/integrations/button\">button</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/image\">image</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/select\">select</a>, and <a href=\"/integrations/switch\">switch</a> templates\nentities, straight from the UI. Awesome job <a href=\"https://github.com/dougiteixeira\">@dougiteixeira</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a> added a button to the actions developer tools to copy the action\nresponse as JSON for use in templates. Nice!</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/dashboards/picture/\">picture</a>, <a href=\"/dashboards/picture-elements/\">picture elements</a>, <a href=\"/dashboards/picture-entity/\">picture entity</a>, and <a href=\"/dashboards/picture-glance/\">picture glance</a> cards\ncan now get their image from the person entity! You don’t need to set a static\nimage to represent a person, it will now automatically fetch the person’s picture\nfor you. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Quentame\">@Quentame</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Integrations and helpers set up via YAML, now visible in the UI!</h2>\n<p>Most popular <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> and helpers can be set up directly from the\nHome Assistant user interface. However, we still have a lot of older or less\nused integrations that can only be set up using <a href=\"/docs/configuration/yaml/\">manual YAML configuration</a>.\nWe are working hard to move <a href=\"#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui\">more and more of these integrations to the UI</a>,\nhowever, this takes time and effort.</p>\n<p>The problem with these integrations is that they are not visible in the UI\nwhen they are set up using YAML. What we often see is that someone sets up\nan integration using YAML and then cannot see it on the integrations page,\noften resulting in questions in our community about where to find it.</p>\n<p>As of this release, we have drastically improved this situation. All integrations,\nregardless of how they are set up, are now visible on the integrations page\nin the UI. This means that even if you set up an integration using YAML,\nyou can now find it in the UI and view its provided entities.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/yaml-integration-listed.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the demo integration, which is set up manually via YAML, showing up in the UI on the integrations dashboard.\">\n<p>Integrations originating from manual YAML configuration can be recognized by the\n<iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:file-code-outline' title='File code outline'></iconify-icon> icon showing on their cards.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we also have <a href=\"/integrations/#helper\">many helpers</a> that can be set up\nusing YAML configuration.

An awesome and huge release is coming your way this month!\n11! new integrations and 7! integrations are now available via the UI;\nWe have many noteworthy improvements to integrations\nand even more noteworthy improvements to Home Assistant itself.\nAnd that… is just the tip of the iceberg! 🗻\nI’m most excited about the new badges for your dashboard.\nI mean, the old ones weren’t the prettiest, but these new ones are definitely\ngorgeous! Oh! And if you missed the last dashboard stream, I would highly recommend\nwatching the recording of it, as\nit is very insightful!\nThis release also marks a significant milestone in the history of Home Assistant,\nas we are saying goodbye to service calls.\nServices have been around since day one, but we are now moving to actions,\nmaking things much easier to explain to people new to Home Assistant.\nEnjoy the release! 🎉\n../Frenck\n\n\nDashboards - Chapter 2\n\nNew badges for your dashboard\nOptimized information density for the Sections view\n\n\nGoodbye service calls, hello actions 👋\nSort data tables by created or last modified\nControl Home Assistant using AI with Ollama\nIntegrations\n\nNew integrations\nNoteworthy improvements to existing integrations\nIntegrations reaching platinum quality level\nNow available to set up from the UI\nFarewell to the following\n\n\nZigbee Home Automation (ZHA) updates\nMatter updates\nKNX can now be managed via the UI\nOther noteworthy changes\nIntegrations and helpers set up via YAML, now visible in the UI!\nPatch releases\n\n2024.8.1 - August 10\n2024.8.2 - August 16\n2024.8.3 - August 25\n\n\nNeed help? Join the community!\nBackward-incompatible changes\nAll changes\n\nDashboards - Chapter 2\nAs part of our roadmap, work has\ncontinued on making dashboard customization and organization easier and more\nintuitive.\nLast week, we had the “Dashboards Chapter 2”\nlive stream, talking about the current state of the dashboards, the progress\nwe have made, the upcoming features, and improvements we are working on, but\nmore importantly: The great insights in all our research and the design philosophy\nbehind the dashboards. In case you missed it, you can watch the 1-hour recording\non our YouTube channel or\nread the recap blog post.\nAs part of our continuous improvement, this month we have fully redesigned\nand revamped the badges for your dashboards!\nNew badges for your dashboard\nWe already wrote about it extensively in our Dashboard Chapter 2 blog post\nand this release introduces our redesigned badges!\nThis is a big revamp of the original badges that have been in Home Assistant\nsince, well, forever. The new badges are designed to match the design of the\nMushroom chip cards, and are meant to sit at the top of a dashboard view,\nproviding a summary of the most important information that you need to know\nat a glance.\n\nThese new badges match the functionality of the previous design but are\nnow even more feature-rich. Of course, they are fully configurable from the UI,\nallowing you to tweak them to your needs. You can specify whether the icon,\nname, and/or state will be visible, and you can configure the contents within\neach of them.\nEverything can, of course, be dragged and dropped in the order you like 😎\nNot just that, the new badges also come with visibility options, the same\nas we have introduced for cards in Home Assistant 2024.6.\nThis means you can show or hide them based on who is viewing the dashboard, what\nscreen size it is displayed within, whether an entity is in a certain state,\nand more.\n\nThe best news of all? The new badges work across both the new sections view and\nthe old masonry view! 🎉 Heck!, we even have support for custom badges, like the\ncustom template one released by the Mushroom project 🍄.\nIf you have existing old-style badges today, don’t worry! They will be\nautomatically converted to the new badges when you upgrade to this release.\nOptimized information density for the Sections view\nFor this release, we have also fine-tuned the design grid for our\nexperimental Sections view.\nThe height of each row has been reduced, allowing more information to be\ndisplayed on the screen. Hours of pixel pushing have also reduced the gap\nbetween the Tile card contents and its\nfeatures, resulting in a cleaner and more\nuniform appearance.\n\n\nThe 2024.7 release on the left and this 2024.8 release on the right.\n\nIf you have been experimenting with sections and have resized some of your\ncards, you may need to readjust the sizes to accommodate these changes.\nGoodbye service calls, hello actions 👋\nThis release marks an important milestone in the evolution of Home Assistant:\nwe are saying goodbye to service calls and hello to actions!\nIf you are a long-time user of Home Assistant reading this now: don’t be alarmed\nby this change, nothing breaks with this, and everything will continue to work\njust as it did before.\nIn the 2024.1 release, we unified the actions\nin the Home Assistant automationAutomations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home. [Learn more] & script editors. The goal of\nthat change was to make our automation editor easier for newer users to\nunderstand by removing the “Service call” layer and terminology.\n\nThe above screenshot shows the UI that has been in use since the January release,\nand was very well received in general. However, the underlying terminology\nin our documentation and all other places in Home Assistant still used the\n“service call” terminology.\nAdditionally, the term “services” in Home Assistant is overloaded and ambiguous.\nIt is used for both the services you can call in Home Assistant and services you\nmight integrate with, like weather or music services. In the latter case, we\nare talking about integrating with a service provided by a program or website,\nwhich is referenced in our Settings page as Devices & services. 😵‍💫\nTo make things clearer, we are now changing the terminology around\nservice calls in Home Assistant from “services” to “actions” everywhere.\nEvery occurrence in the documentation, the UI, the code, and everywhere else\nin Home Assistant, has been replaced with “action”. Unlike the previous services\nwhich were “called”, actions are “performed”.\n\n\n   Important\n  \nIf you write automations in YAML, you will notice that the service key\nin your actions is now called action. For example:\n- action: light.turn_on\n  target:\n    area: living_room\n\nExisting UI-managed automations will be automatically converted the next time they\nare edited and saved. If you write automation in YAML, you can\nuse either action or service, as this change is fully backward compatible,\nbut we recommend using action from now on.\n  \n\nSort data tables by created or last modified\nYou’ve added a new integration, a new device, or maybe just updated\nHome Assistant and wondering what new entities or devices you have available?\nThis release will help you with that. Home Assistant now tracks when entities\nand devices, and many other things were created or last modified. If these are\nshown in a table, it means you can now sort them by the date they were created\nor last modified; helping you find those recently added or modified items.\n\nThe created and modified columns are hidden by default, but you can make them\nvisible by clicking the  icon at the top right of the\ntable. Sorting is always available, regardless of the columns’ visibility.\nYou might notice that most entities and devices do not have this created or\nmodified data populated yet. Well this data has only started being recorded in\nthis release, and cannot be applied retroactively, but going forward it should\nonly get more useful.\nControl Home Assistant using AI with Ollama\nIn the 2024.6 release, we introduced the ability to use the OpenAI and\nGoogleAI integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] to control your home using Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Many of you requested this to work with a local hosted LLM as well.\nToday we are happy to announce that Home Assistant now supports\ncontrol via local LLMs too!\nThis is achieved thanks to @Shulyaka adding support for the brand new tools\nAPI in Ollama. The performance of the local models has been fine tuned by\n@AllenPorter.\nAllen created a new LLM benchmark suite that is more balanced, less focused\non edge cases, and uses fewer exposed entities. We scored the different models\nwith this new benchmark, and the cloud-based models scored 98%, but local LLMs\ndid not do nearly as well.\nThrough prompt tuning and fixes included in this release, we have gotten local\nLLMs to score a reasonable 84%. We will continue to test new models while\nimproving our prompts and tools to achieve a higher score.\n\n\nOverview of performance of Ollama running different local models ran against the LLM benchmark suite.\n\nIf you want to experiment with local LLMs using Home Assistant, we currently\nrecommend using the Llama 3.1 8B model and exposing fewer than 25 entities. Note\nthat smaller models are more likely to make mistakes.\nIntegrations\nThanks to our community for keeping pace with the new integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more]\nand improvements to existing ones! You’re all awesome 🥰\nNew integrations\nWe welcome the following new integrations in this release:\n\nAutarco, added by @klaasnicolaas\nMonitor the performance of your Autarco connected solar panels, inverters, and batteries.\nBryant Evolution, added by @danielsmyers\nControl your Bryant Evolution HVAC system.\nDio Chacon, added by @cnico\nConnect your Dio Chacon devices via RF 433 Mhz or Wi-Fi.\nElevenLabs, added by @sorgfresser\nElevenLabs text-to-speech service, provides natural sounding voices.\niotty, added by @pburgio\nControl your iotty Smart Home light switch, gate, smart cover, and outlet devices.\nIronOS, added by @tr4nt0r\nIntegrate your IronOS-powered soldering iron with Home Assistant over Bluetooth.\nIsrael Rail, added by @shaiu\nGet real-time departure information from the Israel railways.\nLinkPlay, added by @dukeofphilberg\nControl various media players based on the LinkPlay protocol.\nmadVR Envy, added by @iloveicedgreentea\nControl your madVR Envy video processor for your home theater.\nSimplefin, added by @jeeftor\nSimpleFIN is a financial data provider that offers a simple and easy-to-use API for retrieving financial data.\nTesla Fleet, added by @Bre77\nThrough the Tesla Fleet API, you can connect and monitor various sensors from Tesla vehicles, PowerWall, Solar panels, or Wall connectors.\n\nThis release also has new virtual integrations. Virtual integrations\nare stubs that are handled by other (existing) integrations to help with\nfindability. These ones are new:\n\nMercury NZ Limited, provided by Opower, added by @SplicedNZ\nMINI Connected, provided by BMW Connected Drive, added by @rikroe\nPinecil, provided by ironOS, added by @tr4nt0r\n\nNoteworthy improvements to existing integrations\nIt is not just new integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] that have been added; existing\nintegrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy\nchanges to existing integrations:\n\nThe HomeKit Bridge integration now supports the event entities representing\ndoorbells and motion sensors. Big thanks @bdraco!\nTo use the above HomeKit feature, @bdraco added support for event entities\nto the UniFi Protect, Doorbird, and August integrations. Awesome!\nTalking about event entities, @mib1185 added event entities to the\nFeedreader integration. So you can now easily automate when a new article\nshows up in one of the news feeds you follow. Great!\nThe OpenAI conversation integration now defaults to the, much cheaper,\ngpt-4o-mini model. Thanks @allenporter!\nThe WLED integration now supports CCT LED strips, thanks to @Suxsem!\nTessie received lots of attention from @Bre77 this release, adding\ntons of new entities and features to the integration. Great job!\n@joostlek and @andrew-codechimp have been extending the Mealie\nintegration with a lot of new actions and features. Most notably, the ability to\nimport recipes, set meal plans, and view shopping lists. Thanks!\nYou can now control your Reolink chime with the Reolink integration, thanks\nto @starkillerOG!\nThe Roborock integration now supports the Roborock Zeo washer/dryer.\nCool @Lash-L!\n@tr4nt0r migrated the Habitica Dailies and to-do’s to support our\nto-do entities. Nice!\nThanks to @tanchu, the Xiaomi Miio integration now supports Xiaomi\nair purifiers and humidifiers. Great!\n@bieniu extended the Shelly integration to support Shelly virtual components.\nThese virtual components can be used to add Home Assistant entities to your\nShelly device, such as the Shelly WallDisplay dashboard, or pass\nHome Assistant sensor data to Shelly scripts. Nice!\n\nIntegrations reaching platinum quality level\nThe following integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] have reached the platinum 🏆 level on our\nintegration quality scale. These integrations are\nthe best of the best and give you an excellent out-of-the-box experience.\n\nBMW Connected Drive, done by @rikroe\nTechnoVE, done by @Moustachauve\nTessie, done by @Bre77\n\nCongratulations to all the developers who worked on these integrations!\nNow available to set up from the UI\nWhile most integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] can be set up directly from the Home Assistant\nuser interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving\nmore integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone\nto set up and use.\nThe following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:\n\nBluesound, done by @LouisChrist\nGenius Hub, done by @GeoffAtHome\nHistory stats, done by @gjohansson-ST\nMastodon, done by @andrew-codechimp\nRussound RIO, done by @noahhusby\nWake on LAN, done by @gjohansson-ST\nWorldclock, done by @gjohansson-ST\n\nFarewell to the following\nThe following integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] are also no longer available as\nof this release:\n\nUE Smart Radio has been removed; the service has been discontinued.\n\nZigbee Home Automation (ZHA) updates\nThe Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA) got a massive overhaul this release!\nWhat this means for you? Well… basically: nothing! And this sounds odd,\nbut that is a good thing!\nThe whole integration has been split into a separate codebase, making it\neasier to maintain and improve. This is a huge step forward for the integration,\nand took months of work to get done.\nYou will not notice anything different right now, but this change will make the\nintegration easier to maintain and improve in the future, including allowing\ncode contributors to contribute more easily.\nThanks for the dedication and the huge amounts of hard work on this integration\n@dmulcahey, @puddly, and @TheJulianJES! 🥰\nMatter updates\nThere are a couple of updates for the Matter integration this release, while we\nare working hard to get the integration ready for official Matter certification.\nThe Matter integration can now provide update entities. If your Matter device\nhas a firmware update available, Home Assistant will now be able to inform you\nabout it and update the device for you. 🎉\n\nThis update feature is available for all Matter devices, where manufacturers\nprovide firmware updates via the official Matter update channels. Not many\nmanufacturers are involved in delivering these updates yet, but this is a great\nstep forward, and we hope many manufacturers using Matter will follow this\nexample.\nEvent entities provided by the Matter integration have been improved. They\nwill now provide more event types, allowing you to react to things like single\npress or double press events with ease.\nAdditionally, @jvmahon contributed support for select entities to the Matter\nintegration. This is used to select modes if your Matter device supports them,\nsuch as laundry, oven, or dishwasher modes.\nThese last two features, are amazing improvements to the Matter integration,\nbut they are mainly a highlight. Many Matter device types have seen improvements,\nincluding more (configuration) entities and other improvements.\nKNX can now be managed via the UI\nThe KNX integration introduces the ability to manage entities directly from the\nUI. 🎉\nIf you have an ETS project file, configuring your devices is now more\nintuitive; you can easily select an actuator from the side panel and drag and\ndrop its assigned group addresses into the configuration. Alternatively,\naddresses can be found by name or number using dropdown menus.\nCreate, update, and delete KNX switch and light entities directly from the KNX\npanel without touching any YAML. 😎\n\nMore improvements have been made under the hood. One of the most notable changes\nis the support for a broader range of Data Point Type (DPT) definitions. These\ncan be used directly within actions and triggers and inspected\nin the KNX GroupMonitor.\nThank you for working so hard on this one @farmio; this is awesome! 🥰\nOther noteworthy changes\nThere are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other\nnoteworthy changes this release:\n\nWe are proud of our Open Home Foundation, so we will now show its pretty\nlogo on the Home Assistant loading and information screens. Thanks @balloob!\nTimer support using Assist for mobile devices. This means you can now\ncontrol timers from your mobile device or tablet. Thanks @balloob!\nYou can now ask Assist for the current time and date, thanks @synesthesiam!\n@synesthesiam also switched our voice activity detection to microVAD!\nUsing this we are able to detect the end of a speech command much better\nin noisy environments, even with music in the background. Cool!\nThe picture elements card can now be fully managed in the UI using a\nbrand-new visual editor. Fantastic work there @karwosts!\nHome Assistant will now raise a repair issue if a script can’t be set up\n(for example, because of YAML syntax errors). Thanks @emontnemery!\nIf Home Assistant finds an integration set up that has been removed\n(like when you remove a custom integration), it will now raise a repair issue\nto help you clean up anything left behind. Thanks @joostlek!\nGroup now has support for grouping two new entity types. @joostlek added\nsupport for grouping notify entities, and @frenck added support for grouping\nbutton entities. Nice!\nThe Generic Thermostat and Hygrostat helpers will now be linked to the\ndevice that provided the actuator entity, thanks @dougiteixeira!\n@gjohansson-ST did the same, he added a link to the History stats helper\nto the device that provided the sensor entity.\nYou can now set up button, image, select, and switch templates\nentities, straight from the UI. Awesome job @dougiteixeira!\n@karwosts added a button to the actions developer tools to copy the action\nresponse as JSON for use in templates. Nice!\nThe picture, picture elements, picture entity, and picture glance cards\ncan now get their image from the person entity! You don’t need to set a static\nimage to represent a person, it will now automatically fetch the person’s picture\nfor you. Thanks @Quentame!\n\nIntegrations and helpers set up via YAML, now visible in the UI!\nMost popular integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] and helpers can be set up directly from the\nHome Assistant user interface. However, we still have a lot of older or less\nused integrations that can only be set up using manual YAML configuration.\nWe are working hard to move more and more of these integrations to the UI,\nhowever, this takes time and effort.\nThe problem with these integrations is that they are not visible in the UI\nwhen they are set up using YAML. What we often see is that someone sets up\nan integration using YAML and then cannot see it on the integrations page,\noften resulting in questions in our community about where to find it.\nAs of this release, we have drastically improved this situation. All integrations,\nregardless of how they are set up, are now visible on the integrations page\nin the UI. This means that even if you set up an integration using YAML,\nyou can now find it in the UI and view its provided entities.\n\nIntegrations originating from manual YAML configuration can be recognized by the\n icon showing on their cards.\nSimilarly, we also have many helpers that can be set up\nusing YAML configuration. These sometimes showed up in the UI, but often did not.\nWe have adjusted this as well, and made sure that all helpers are now visible\nin the UI, regardless of how they are set up.\n\n   Note\n  \nThings set up manually using YAML are still managed using YAML. This means that\nif you want to change the configuration of these integrations or helpers, you\nwill need to do so in the YAML configuration files.\n  \n\nPatch releases\nWe will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.8 in August. These\npatch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch every\nweek (around Friday).\n2024.8.1 - August 10\n\nAdd support for v3 Coinbase API (@TomBrien - #116345)\nBump OpenWeatherMap to 0.1.1 (@freekode - #120178)\nFix limit and order property for transmission integration (@fustom -

Unfortunately, sometimes,\nit is inevitable.\nWe always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as\npossible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:\n\n  \n    \n      Recorder database upgrade notice\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThis notice applies only if you use the recorder integration with a MySQL or\nPostgreSQL database. If you are using the default SQLite database,\nyou can ignore it.\nThis release includes a database upgrade/migration that increases the size of\nthe number we can store for the identifier fields. For a more technical\nexplanation, we are upgrading integer fields for ID columns from a 32-bit\ninteger to BIGINT, which is a 64-bit integer.\nThis can cause the database upgrade to take longer than usual, depending on\nthe size of your database.\nPlease be patient and let the upgrade process finish. Do not interrupt the\nupgrade process, as this can lead to a corrupted database.\n(@emontnemery - #121025) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      BlinkStick\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThe Blinksticklight integration is disabled because it requires software that\nis not open source.

Radio station providers (like TuneIn and\nRadio Paradise) are no longer part of the source list and are not selectable\nas sources.\nPresets that play a specific radio station can be created in the BluOS app and\nare displayed as sources in Home Assistant.\nThe currently selected source tries to match those presets and falls back to\nthe radio station provider (like TuneIn, Radio Paradise).\n(@LouisChrist - #117257) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      BMW Connected Drive\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nDescribing attributes car and vin have been removed from BMW entities.\nIf you need to look them up, please get them from the device info screen.\n(@rikroe - [#120830]) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Climate\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nScenes that use the deprecated auxiliary heat (aux_heat attribute)\nwill no longer restore/set the auxiliary heat state when the scene\nis activated.\n(@bjpetit - #121873) (documentation)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Concord232\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \nThe Concord232 integration is disabled because it requires software that\nis not open source.
