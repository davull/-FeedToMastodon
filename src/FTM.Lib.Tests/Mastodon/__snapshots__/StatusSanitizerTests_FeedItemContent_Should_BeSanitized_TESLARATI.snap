    "sanitized": "Ahead of the rollout of V4-compatible power cabinets, Tesla has highlighted that faster charging speeds for the Cybertruck are now available at certain charging stations with V4 Supercharging posts.\n\nOn Friday, Tesla’s Charging account on X highlighted that the Cybertruck can now charge at speeds of up to 325kW at select Supercharger sites with V4 charging stalls. The news comes as Tesla prepares to start rolling out its V4 charging cabinets in early 2025, which will enable speeds of up to 500kW.\nTesla North American Charging Director Max de Zegher also reposted the news on X, clarifying that, eventually, all V4 posts with a V3 cabinet would enable 325kW charging speeds, and likely even in the coming weeks. He also points out that these Cybertrucks are charging at 400v at 325kW, though they’ll eventually be able to access the full capabilities of their 800v charging architecture with the arrival of the V4 cabinet.\nWhere can Tesla Cybertrucks charge at speeds of up to 325kW?\nBelow is the full list of initial sites where Tesla Cybertrucks can charge at 325kW, as shared by Tesla. The company also says it’s aiming to roll out access to even more locations.\n\nLebec, CA\nChemult, OR\nColumbus, GA – Macon Road\nDayton, OH – North Springboro Pike\nDunnigan, CA – County Road\nLamoni, IA\nWilsonville, OR\nTruckee, CA – Deerfield Drive\nHarrison, NY\nFarr West, UT\nTacoma, WA – S 40th Street\nHighland, CA – 4154 E Highland Ave\nMelissa, TX\nCedar Park, TX – East Whitestone Boulevard\nGillette, WY – South Douglas Highway\nRockaway, NJ – Green Pond Road\nMesa, AZ – South Signal Butte Road\nBlaine, WA – Boblett Street\nSanta Ynez, CA\n\nTesla’s latest charging improvements and milestones\nTesla quietly started rolling out its upgraded V4 Superchargers in North America and other markets throughout much of last year, though the community was quick to point out that the power cabinets also required updates to allow for faster charging speeds. In August, however, Tesla did confirm that it was performing trials of faster charging speeds on the V4 stalls at select Supercharger locations, hinting that these updates were not far off and that even sites with V3 cabinets would likely soon access faster charging.\nIn the past, Tesla and de Zegher have also highlighted the advantages of building prefabricated charging units at the Gigafactory in Buffalo, New York, which come in pre-built structures with four stall units that are delivered to the site. For one, Tesla has said that the prefab units now take the company just four days from delivery to installation, meaning that it can deploy charging stations faster than ever.\nUltimately, the charging executive also says that the cost-savings that come from building Supercharger stalls this way will be passed onto the customer, following suit recent price reductions that have been spotted in both the North American and European markets in recent weeks.\nYou can see a rendering of the total supplies needed for four V4 Supercharger stalls (left) compared to the pre-assembled Supercharger units (right) below.\n\nCredit: Max de Zegher | X\nWhat are your thoughts?

    "sanitized": "A Delaware judge has cleared the way for Elon Musk and Tesla to begin a legal appeal process for Musk’s 2018 pay package. The appeal process is a key step in the company’s attempt to try and reinstate the CEO’s $56 billion high-risk, high-reward compensation plan.\n\n\n\nTesla has previously announced that it would be appealing Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick’s ruling, which overruled a vote from a majority of Tesla shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey updates: \n\n\n\nChancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery recently issued an order that opens a 30-day window for an appeal to be filed with the Delaware Supreme Court, as noted in a Reuters report.With this, Elon Musk and Tesla’s board that approved the CEO’s 2018 compensation plan could appeal McCormick’s ruling in January. Tesla also has the opportunity to appeal McCormick’s order that required Tesla to pay $345 million to the attorneys who represented Richard Tornetta, a TSLA shareholder with nine shares who initiated the lawsuit in 2018 in protest against Musk’s pay package.\n\n\n\nJudge’s concerns:\n\n\n\nMcCormick has alleged that Musk and the Tesla board breached their fiduciary duty to investors by approving a pay package that she described as “unfathomable” in size.Tesla shareholders ratified Elon Musk’s 2018 compensation plan at the company’s 2024 Annual Shareholders Meeting. The ratification was achieved by a large majority of TSLA stockholders. Despite the Tesla shareholders’ ratification, McCormick declined to reconsider her January ruling earlier this month.\n\n\n\nA Delaware judge just overruled a supermajority of shareholders who own Tesla and who voted twice to pay @elonmusk what he’s worth. The court’s decision is wrong, and we’re going to appeal.This ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs’ lawyers run Delaware…— Tesla (@Tesla) December 2, 2024 \n\n\n\nTesla’s rebuttal:\n\n\n\nTesla responded by stating that it would be appealing the judge’s decision.“A Delaware judge just overruled a supermajority of shareholders who own Tesla and who voted twice to pay Elon Musk what he’s worth. The court’s decision is wrong, and we’re going to appeal. This ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs’ lawyers run Delaware companies rather than their rightful owners – the shareholders,” Tesla wrote in its official account on X.Reuters noted that the Delaware Supreme Court can take about a year to issue a ruling on such appeals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.
