It's not a new model or anything in the realm of Sora, but OpenAI's customization for models will now support reinforcement fine-tuning.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video\" data-nosnippet ><div class=\"video-aspect-box\"><iframe data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMJMhBFa_Gc\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2038px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:55.15%;\"><img id=\"bq6xdj72vMbtuxNrGZQCCU\" name=\"image (2)\" alt=\"Create a fine-tuned model in o1 mini.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bq6xdj72vMbtuxNrGZQCCU.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2038\" height=\"1124\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>While this is not necessarily consumer-focused, OpenAI welcomed Justin Reese, a researcher for rare genetic diseases at Berkeley University. Now, in a live demo on o1 mini, we're trying to have the model ID genes from a sample data pool that might be responsible for a disease. Of course, it will be fact-checked against known results, but it's a good test of reinforcement fine-tuning for validation on o1 mini.</p><p>Furthermore, within o1 mini, you can refine and customize this fine-tuning process. The aim is to let you get the most out of the data by tweaking the model to your specific needs. It was noted that depending on the amount of data and the task, it can take anywhere from a few seconds to hours to complete.</p><p>The results at the end will be plotted within an evaluation dashboard with several presets.</p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2042px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:54.95%;\"><img id=\"hTTsWKH4VK6j9yeFmj5JM3\" name=\"Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 1.14.01 PM\" alt=\"An example of an evaluation dashboard within o1 mini.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hTTsWKH4VK6j9yeFmj5JM3.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2042\" height=\"1122\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Of course, OpenAI had to bring us back down to earth with another joke, though this time, we didn't get to hear Sam Altman laugh at it, though.

That's not a bad start, and we fully expect to see even more huge reveals throughout the event.We're here to cover everything \"12 days of OpenAI\" throughout the coming days, so grab a cup of hot beverage, sit back, and relax, as we uncover the next era of OpenAI software.\nLIVE UPDATES\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\nWelcome to TechRadar's \"12 days of OpenAI\" live blog, where our resident AI experts will be taking you through the next 12 (well, 11) days of everything exciting coming out of the world's most famous AI company.What will Sam Altman reveal? How will these new updates and products change the way we use artificial intelligence? Who knows, but we're incredibly excited to find out.\n(Image credit: OpenAI)\nYesterday, OpenAI kicked off the 12-day event with the announcement that the company's o1 reasoning model would no longer be in preview, ready for everyone to try.The AI model thrives with scientific equations and math problems with OpenAI saying o1 can solve 83% of the problems in the International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam, a massive improvement on GPT-4o, which only scored 13%. The new model makes fewer errors than the preview version, cutting down on major mistakes by 34%.That wasn't the only reveal, however...\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\nOpenAI also announced ChatGPT Pro yesterday, but who is it actually aimed at?For $200/month ChatGPT Pro gives you unlimited usage and an even smarter version of o1 with \"more benefits to come!\"The fact is that for almost everybody the current $20 a month ChatGPT Plus option will be easily sufficient. Perhaps it can do special things (like writing \"David Mayer\" with no problems), but it seems hard to justify beyond a select few users who need massive computing power. To me, the $200 price point seems more like a price anchor. Essentially, it makes the $20 ChatGPT Plus price point look really good value.\n(Image credit: Open AI)\nOne of the biggest announcements we expect to see over the next week or so is the official launch of Sora, OpenAI's video generator which can transform a text prompt into an incredible video.Sora was leaked last month by unhappy artists who have accused OpenAI of taking advantage for unpaid research and development purposes. There's definitely a debate to be had on how OpenAI trains its AI models, but that's maybe one for another day.In terms of what Sora offers, well, imagine one of the best AI image generators, but video. I've not tried Sora yet, but from the demos online, it looks pretty awesome.\n(Image credit: OpenAI)\nWhat are TechRadar's predictions for day 2 of OpenAI's \"12 days of OpenAI\" I hear you cry?  Well, Sam Altman said that we can expect \"some big ones and some stocking stuffers\" throughout the 12 days, and considering that yesterday we got a brand new version of ChatGPT (ChatGPT o1) I'd predict that today's Xmas gift from OpenAI will be more of a \"stocking stuffer\" than one of the \"big ones\".Perhaps a minor update to ChatGPT search or ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode. What am I really hoping for? I want ChatGPT search to be rolled out to all users on the free tier. Fingers crossed!\nOpenAI's next livestream kicks off at 10 am PT / 1 pm ET / 6 pm GMT and you can watch it live directly from OpenAI's website.If you go to the \"12 days of OpenAI\" section of the website right now, you'll see a gorgeous advent calendar, hinting at the exciting days to come. Just like an advent calendar, some days will be better than others, so I'm very intrigued to see if OpenAI keeps up the momentum or if today isn't quite as stellar as yesterday.Bookmark that link too, as you'll be able to revisit all the highlights from the events even if you miss one of the livestreams. Or, you could keep checking in with TechRadar as we'll keep you up to date on everything you need to know over the next week or so.\nOpenAI o1 is now out of preview in ChatGPT.What’s changed since the preview? A faster, more powerful reasoning model that’s better at coding, math & writing.o1 now also supports image uploads, allowing it to apply reasoning to visuals for more detailed & useful responses. pic.twitter.com/hrLiID3MhJDecember 5, 2024\nIf you're just joining us, OpenAI announced the official launch of o1 yesterday, with a \"faster, more powerful reasoning model that's better at coding, math & writing.\"If you want to try it out yourself, just head to ChatGPT and choose the o1 model from the dropdown. Give it a try on your math homework, or a coding challenge, you might be surprised by the results.\n(Image credit: OpenAI)\nChatGPT uses Dall-E 3 for image generation, which is right up there with the current crop of AI image generators on the market, however, it's starting to look a little long in the tooth. New upcoming AI image generators like Flux have been slowly getting better and better. Could we see a new version of Dall-E in our 12 days of OpenAI? It's a hotly tipped possibility. If OpenAI can give us image generation that's better than Flux Pro then it will certainly be a happy holiday season for everybody.\n\nI mentioned Sora earlier, but just in case you haven't heard of the AI video generator, here's an unbelievable trailer from OpenAI showing just what it's capable of.My personal favorite here is the prompt \"a litter of golden retriever puppies playing in the snow. Their heads pop out of the snow.\"How can AI be so cute? I can't quite wrap my head around it.\n(Image credit: Future)\nHere's another prediction for \"12 Days of OpenAI\" announcements: videochatGPT. You might be familiar with the Norad Santa Tracker It's a fun way to track Santa's flight around the world on the 24th of December. This year I'm thinking that it's the perfect time for OpenAI to take this a step further with an AI Santa video call demo as part of a new AI video ChatGPT. So, imagine talking to ChatGPT just like you're currently doing in ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode, but you're seeing a video avatar talk back to you. Santa Claus would be the perfect video avatar to kick this off, and it would delight children everywhere. Let's just hope AI Santa doesn't start hallucinating because the result could be hilarious...\n(Image credit: Future)\nOne of the nice things about Day 1 of OpenAI's \"12 days of OpenAI\" was its brevity. When Sam Altman sat down before us with three of his engineers, we wondered it we were in for hours of exposition on major AI updates across every aspect of OpenAI's business. Turned out that OpenAI was really spreading out all its news over 12 days. Yes, that means we're in for a lot over the next week or so but at least we can count on each day of news being digestible.On the other hand, can we get to that Sora update and release today? Please? We're just 10 minutes from finding out...\nDay 2 of '12 Days of OpenAI' is now kicking off, and Sam Altman is not here. Instead, some other team members are teasing a tool that will arrive next year. It's not a new model or anything in the realm of Sora, but OpenAI's customization for models will now support reinforcement fine-tuning.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\nWhile this is not necessarily consumer-focused, OpenAI welcomed Justin Reese, a researcher for rare genetic diseases at Berkeley University. Now, in a live demo on o1 mini, we're trying to have the model ID genes from a sample data pool that might be responsible for a disease. Of course, it will be fact-checked against known results, but it's a good test of reinforcement fine-tuning for validation on o1 mini.Furthermore, within o1 mini, you can refine and customize this fine-tuning process. The aim is to let you get the most out of the data by tweaking the model to your specific needs. It was noted that depending on the amount of data and the task, it can take anywhere from a few seconds to hours to complete.The results at the end will be plotted within an evaluation dashboard with several presets.\n(Image credit: Future)\nOf course, OpenAI had to bring us back down to earth with another joke, though this time, we didn't get to hear Sam Altman laugh at it, though. With Christmas fast approaching and the business being based in San Fransisco – home to many a self-driving car – it's pretty on point.The joke went along the lines of: We live in San Fransisco, self-driving vehicles are all the rage, and Santa's been trying to get in on this. He's been trying to make a self driving sleigh, but it keeps hitting trees left and right. Any guesses? He didn't pine-tune his models.To help you better visualize it, TechRadar's Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff asked ChatGPT to create an image of it.\n(Image credit: ChatGPT)\nWhile Sam Altman was not on today's Day 2 presentation of Open AI's 12 days of announcements, the executive did take to X (formerly Twitter) to shed some more light on reinforcement finetuning – including a promised public rollout of early 2025 in quarter one.\ntoday we are announcing reinforcement finetuning, which makes it really easy to create expert models in specific domains with very little training data.livestream going now: https://t.co/ABHFV8NiKcalpha program starting now, launching publicly in q1December 6, 2024\n(Image credit: Future)\nIf you've been wondering if 12 Days of OpenAI would continue over the weekend – on Saturday, December 7, and Sunday, December 8, respectively – the company isn't leaving us hanging.OpenAI is pausing its 12-day daily announcements until Monday, December 9, writing \"Continuing Monday at 10AM PT\" on its homepage. This certainly gives us all the weekend to ponder what else is in store. Hopefully, next week, we will see the official reveal of Sora or at least some more details about it.The first two days were busy with the launch of the o1 reasoning model, a new Pro tier, and a deep dive into reinforcement tuning as demoed on the latest model.\nIt sounds like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is as disappointed as we are that there will be no new 12 Days of OpenAI announcements until Monday. He has tweeted to say he can't wait until he can share more news with us and that, \"Monday feels so far away\".\ni am so, so excited for what we have to launch on day 3. monday feels so far away.December 7, 2024\n(Image credit: JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images)\nIf you're expecting to see GPT-5 as part of the \"12 days of OpenAI\", I've got bad news for you, kind of.Just last month, OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, said during a Reddit AMA (Ask me anything), “We have some very good releases coming later this year! Nothing that we are going to call GPT-5, though.\"Well, later this year has arrived, so maybe we will see a new ChatGPT model over the next few days but don't expect it to have a 5 in its name.\n(Image credit: Apple)\nWhile you're waiting for the next announcement from OpenAI's 12 Days of OpenAI, due at 10am PT today, perhaps you'd like to read a guide to using ChatGPT with Siri? With iOS 18.2 on the verge of being released, the next Apple update will give iPhone 16 and iPhone 15 Pro users access to OpenAI's ChatGPT via Siri for the first time.\n\nAfter recent comments made by OpenAI's Chad Nelson at his recent  C21Media keynote in London it looks like we're definitely going to see the release of OpenAI's long-awaited video generation app Sora as part of the 12 Days of OpenAI. A video has surfaced showing a demo of \"Sora V2\", (which begs the question, what happened to version 1?)According to comments made by Nelson in the keynote, the new V2 of Sora will feature 1-minute video output, which can be generated by text to video, text and image to video or text and video to video.See the latest incredible Sora footage in this tweet by Ruud van der Linden:\nSora v2 release is impending:* 1-minute video outputs* text-to-video* text+image-to-video* text+video-to-videoOpenAI's Chad Nelson showed this at the C21Media Keynote in London. And he said we will see it very very soon, as @sama has foreshadowed. pic.twitter.com/xZiDaydoDVDecember 7, 2024\nHotly tipped for release, potentially today, is augmenting ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode with the ability to use your device's video camera as an input, so ChatGPT could 'see' you and use that to perform its queeries. You could use it to ask ChatGPT how you're looking today, and get some feedback, for example. Yes, prepare to be judged by AI.In a demo of the technology OpenAI has already showed us how ChatGPT could be used to roleplay a video interview, giving feedback on how well the person was doing:\n\nA recent tweet by X user akshay suggests that screen sharing could be another input source for ChatGPT, so you could share your screen with the AI and get it to comment on what you're looking at.\nLooks like AVM with video and Screen Share is coming today #OpenAI #Day3 pic.twitter.com/5jah9thpP4December 9, 2024\n(Image credit: OpenAI)\nCircling back to Thursday's announcement of ChatGPT o1, the new model which OpenAI released, along with a faster o1-mini. o1 is better at reasoning and considers things for longer before responding. This makes it better at coding, math and writing. Remember, you can only get access to o1 if you are a Plus or Teams subscriber. Free tier users of ChatGPT stay on ChatGPT-4. Enterprise and Edu users will have access to o1 by Thursday this week.The release of the o1 model makes us think that any further LLM announcements from OpenAI will be unlikely in the coming days, especially of the long-rumored ChatGPT-5.We can't wait to see what today's announcement is, not long to go now! If it's not going to be a new LLM then we'd love the see something in the AI image space, or improvements to ChatGPT search, not to mention the long-awaited Sora.\nOpenAI o1 is now out of preview in ChatGPT.What’s changed since the preview? A faster, more powerful reasoning model that’s better at coding, math & writing.o1 now also supports image uploads, allowing it to apply reasoning to visuals for more detailed & useful responses. pic.twitter.com/hrLiID3MhJDecember 5, 2024\n\nAs if we needed any more hints that Sora, OpenAI's text to video generation tool, will be the Day 3 mystery announcement as part of 12 Days of OpenAI, Marques Brownlee just posted a video review of Sora on his YouTube channel.\n\nBrownlee has been using Sora for a week and calls it, \"a powerful tool that's about to be in the hands of millions of people\". He calls the results he's achieved with Sora both \"horrifying and inspiring at the same time\".As well as the quality of the video Sora can produce, we also get to see some of the cool features of Sora, like the Remix button, which lets you make some slight adjustments to a video you've just generated without having to type the whole prompt in again. Plus there's a Storyboard editor, for stringing together prompts into a timeline.All in all, from this review I'd say that Sora is looking very promising!\nDay 3 of the 12 Days of OpenAI is about to kick off, and it's safe to say that we're expecting Sora, OpenAI's text to video generator, to be the main topic, especially after Marques Brownlee posted a full review earlier this morning.Just like with Days 1 and 2, OpenAI is streaming it on its YouTube channel, and a countdown has already begun.\n\nOpenAI's day 3 stream is live, and Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman wasted no time confirming that Sora is here. It's being launched in the United States and \"most countries\" outside today and will be available on Sora.com for those with a ChatGPT Plus account. Additionally, Sora Turbo is coming today with additional features, including faster processor times.After a brief introduction about Sora and the versions arriving and the broader strokes of video being key to OpenAI, we're now getting a demo of Sora and its interface. Via the \"Featured\" tab under 'Explore' in the interface, you can scroll through a plethora of videos made in Sora, but also clicking on the individual video reveals more details about how the video was created.\nA snapshot of Sam Altman announcing that Sora is launching today. (Image credit: Future)\n(Image credit: Future)\nNow, the OpenAI team is demoing its first video generation, with Sam Altman providing the prompt, \"Woolly mammoth walking through the desert.\" Beyond the prompt, you can choose a resolution—480p to 1080p –, length, and aspect ratio.As we wait for that video to be generated, OpenAI is showing off a new \"Storyboard\" feature, which looks much like a standard timeline. Except it's one where you can drag cards and put in the text describing what you'd like it to generate.Maybe even cooler, though, is that you can use Storyboard to create a video from an image you uploaded; in the example, OpenAI uploaded a photo of a lighthouse to a card and then can add text to generate it in a specific way.\n(Image credit: Future)\nAnd here's the moment we were all waiting for – a look at what Sora created through the prompt \"Woolly mammoth walking through the desert,\" which generated four different versions. If it's not what you wanted to see, you can remix it.\n(Image credit: Future)\nOf course, OpenAI showed off Sora's remix functionality and swapped wooly mammoths for robots, and the results are certainly something. It wasn't instantaneous like the original generation, but it did take a few minutes.\n(Image credit: Future)\nAnd that about wraps about the showcase for Sora. On the subject of availability, Sam Altman noted that Sora is available today in the United States and other countries, but as of now, OpenAI doesn't know when it will launch in Europe and the UK.In terms of generations, if you have a ChatGPT Plus account, you get 50 generations a month, while a ChatGPT Pro account basically allows unlimited generations.\n(Image credit: Future)\nThis is too easy\n(Image credit: Future)\nEditor at Large Lance Ulanoff here.As soon as Sam Altman and company stopped speaking, I hopped onto Sora. First, I had to find it: it's at Sora.com, and then I needed to log in. My corporate account didn't offer support for Sora, but my personal ChatGPT account, which is ChatGPT Plus for now, did. Unlike other ChatGPT models, Sora is a stand-alone desktop app.I verified my age (new, I think, for OpenAI, I think), and then I found myself inside Sora, which starts with a grid of other people's AI video creations.I didn't really look around and instead started typing in the prompt field where I asked for a middle-aged man building a rocketship by the ocean., I described a tranquil scene with the moon, the ocean lapping nearby, a campfire, and a friendly dog.  I didn't touch the default settings: 5 secs, 480p, and instead selected the up arrow to generate my first video.It only took a minute or so for a pair of options to appear. One was a 5-second clip of a dog that started with a tail for its head. The other 5-second video got the dog right but also had the man building a small rocketship model.I'm currently awaiting a remix (I didn't ask for a \"strong remix\") that imagines a full-sized rocket. this second pass, which is possible on all Sora video creations, is taking a lot longer. Even so. Wow.\nWell, that was fast\n(Image credit: Future)\nGuess I wasn't the only one with the idea to hop on the Sora train. As of this moment, the system is at capacity, and while some features in the Sora interface, like storyboarding still work, it can't generate any new AI video because the system is at capacity.It may take a while for things to calm down – it is Day 1, after all – but when they do, you'll want to give Sora a spin. Trust me."

That's okay, you'll almost certainly know its parents, Astell & Kern. Last year, the sub-brand's inaugural product, the Activo's P1 music player, truly wowed us for sound-per-pound value, proving that you don't have to pay an A&K premium to get excellent portable sound. It was so good in fact that it quickly made its way onto our best MP3 player buying guide.And now the South Korean company has announced the hotly anticipated in-ear monitors to go with it. They certainly look the part, which checks out when you know that these wired earbuds are a collaboration with Singaporean brand, DITA Audio.A&K says the partnership brings together \"over 45 years of expertise in the audio industry between Activo and DITA, culminating in the perfect earbud match for the newly released Activo P1 Digital Audio Player.\"\nActivo Q1: specs, pricing and availability\nThe Activo Q1 is, the company tells us, a hybrid IEM featuring DITA’s new PM1+ 9.8mm dynamic driver with brass housing, plus a single Knowles balanced armature driver.DITA Audio has a lovely habit of custom-designing cables to suit every earbud model it's had a hand in, which means the Q1 is a unique proposition – and the white coating certainly makes the earbuds look like they're going to be perfect sonic partners to the wallet-friendly Activo P1.To drill down into that cable a little more, it's the MOCCA2 cable from Cardas, made in the USA. This is custom-built and constructed of 32 strands of Cardas conductors per cable, then twisted to DITA’s own specifications. Your purchase also includes both 4.4mm balanced and 3.5mm single-ended connecting plugs – the P1 has both of these ports, along its top edge.And in case the earbuds look a little dainty, also included with the Q1 is an Activo x DITA branded systainer mini hard case made by Tanos, plus five different sizes of eartips to help you achieve the optimum fit.Have the player, now want the earbuds? You're in luck! The Activo Q1 is available to purchase from Amazon today and is priced at £299 / $349 / €399 (around AU$590).

After the unveiling of the 2025 Golden Globes nominations, I'm curious to see which <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/new-movies\">new movies</a> and shows from the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-tv-streaming-service-cord-cutting-compare\">best streaming services</a> will sweep the biggest awards. With titles from <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/streaming/netflix\">Netflix</a>, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/streaming/hulu\">Hulu</a>, and Mubi leading the pack, this year’s bunch of prospective winners reflects what an immense year it's been for entertainment.</p><p>Indeed, during the Golden Globes 2025 nominations livestream hosted by Mindy Kaling and Morris Chestnut, a slew of movies and shows including <em>The Substance</em>, <em>Slow Horses, </em>and <em>Squid Game</em> were among the incredibly diverse selection of titles to be honored at next year's ceremony, which takes place on January 6.</p><p>But, I have one thing to get off my chest, and it's not a good thing. Netflix’s musical drama <em>Emilia Perez</em> 10 nominations means it swept this year's selection by a handsome margin – and, since I gave it a not-so-pleasant review in my Letterboxd diary, to say I’m shocked that it earned so many nominations is an understatement</p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3000px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.27%;\"><img id=\"Ls2DJZsWDGw29sgqCTcrPG\" name=\"The Bear season 3 Sydney Carmy.jpg\" alt=\"Sydney and Carmy share a quiet moment in The Bear's kitchen in the FX show's third season\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ls2DJZsWDGw29sgqCTcrPG.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3000\" height=\"1688\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\"><em>The Bear</em> leads the television nominations with five nods </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: FX/Hulu/Disney Plus)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>From my 2.5 star scathing review, to me, it’s obvious that<em> Emilia Perez</em> isn’t the movie of the year. That's reflected in the hefty mixed bag of reviews that one of November's <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/new-netflix-movies\">new Netflix movies</a> received, too, but the Golden Globe Foundation appears to have loved it. On paper, a musical crime drama about a cartel boss’ gender transition sounds not only incredibly thrilling, but could make an engaging and inspiring narrative. However, the unhinged musical numbers diminished the sincerity of the story and left me laughing at its characters rather than relating to their individual and collective plights.</p><p>What pushed me over the edge, however, that its overstuffed narrative, comprising three different storylines, get more bizarre as the flick progresses. This is in addition to some unfortunate acting from Selena Gomez (in my view, anyway), which did little to ease my concerns that it's a very disjointed film and is what's primarily fueling my shock at its Golden Globes 2025 nods. You and I will see if it somehow has the pizzazz to win multiple award during next year's glitzy awards event.</p>\n<h2

    "sanitized": "Now that we’re approaching the final weeks of 2024, you can pretty much smell awards season from a mile away. After the unveiling of the 2025 Golden Globes nominations, I'm curious to see which new movies and shows from the best streaming services will sweep the biggest awards. With titles from Netflix, Hulu, and Mubi leading the pack, this year’s bunch of prospective winners reflects what an immense year it's been for entertainment.Indeed, during the Golden Globes 2025 nominations livestream hosted by Mindy Kaling and Morris Chestnut, a slew of movies and shows including The Substance, Slow Horses, and Squid Game were among the incredibly diverse selection of titles to be honored at next year's ceremony, which takes place on January 6.But, I have one thing to get off my chest, and it's not a good thing. Netflix’s musical drama Emilia Perez 10 nominations means it swept this year's selection by a handsome margin – and, since I gave it a not-so-pleasant review in my Letterboxd diary, to say I’m shocked that it earned so many nominations is an understatement\nThe Bear leads the television nominations with five nods (Image credit: FX/Hulu/Disney Plus)\nFrom my 2.5 star scathing review, to me, it’s obvious that Emilia Perez isn’t the movie of the year. That's reflected in the hefty mixed bag of reviews that one of November's new Netflix movies received, too, but the Golden Globe Foundation appears to have loved it. On paper, a musical crime drama about a cartel boss’ gender transition sounds not only incredibly thrilling, but could make an engaging and inspiring narrative. However, the unhinged musical numbers diminished the sincerity of the story and left me laughing at its characters rather than relating to their individual and collective plights.What pushed me over the edge, however, that its overstuffed narrative, comprising three different storylines, get more bizarre as the flick progresses. This is in addition to some unfortunate acting from Selena Gomez (in my view, anyway), which did little to ease my concerns that it's a very disjointed film and is what's primarily fueling my shock at its Golden Globes 2025 nods. You and I will see if it somehow has the pizzazz to win multiple award during next year's glitzy awards event.\nGolden Globes 2025 full nominees list: The Bear, Shogun, Anora, and more \nShogun picked

It appears that this device is the Legion Go 'Lite' that was rumored a few months ago - the eventual official reveal could come alongside a true Legion Go Z1 Extreme successor, using the Z2 Extreme chip.\nThis image, provided by Windows Central, shows a detailed breakdown of what the Legion Go S will look like. (Image credit: WindowsCentral)\nWill this Legion Go alternative be worth a purchase?\nConsidering the rumored specifications that include a 55Wh battery and AMD Radeon 680M GPU, it would be easy to see the Legion Go S as a downgrade. While it is indeed the weaker option compared to the Legion Go Z1 Extreme (which uses the Radeon 780M), it uses a 1920x1200 resolution.It appears that Lenovo has learned its lesson: the Z1 Extreme chip simply could not handle that 2560x1600 resolution. This is the same APU found in the Asus ROG Ally, which uses 1920x1080 resolution, with some games required to run at 900p instead. We aren't sure yet how similar the Z2 Legion Go will perform in comparison to the Z1 Extreme, but there's a high chance that it will be able to handle games at the new target 1200p resolution.Rumors suggest the price will be around €600 (more expensive than the Z1 Extreme ROG Ally), which may be a dealbreaker for many considering the specifications, but we'll have to wait for an official reveal to form any real judgment.\nYou might also like...\nLenovo Legion Go review: this is the true Steam Deck rivalRed Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare is a Halloween treat on the Asus ROG Ally X – but Windows 11 still sucks on gaming handheldsThe next-gen of gaming handhelds is upon us - AMD's Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU could feature 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores meaning greater performance and efficiency"

This boosted graphical fidelity is, more often than not, on par with the Quality Modes of the base PS5, but with a much smoother experience thanks to 60FPS or higher. This best of both worlds approach is really going to be the key difference moving forward, though it’s likely that we’ll see developers experiment further with higher end graphical settings that focus on ray tracing, or make use of the hardware’s new AI-boosted upscaling.</p><p>Speaking on ray tracing, there have been significant advancements for many of the games now enhanced by the PS5 Pro. In our PS5 Pro review, we were impressed by the ray tracing across the board, noting that “you can now enjoy some of the best ray-tracing PS5 has to offer in a performance mode, targeting 60 frames per second, which is truly special in games like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2.” So far, we’re looking at games that have already come out as well, so moving forward we’re excited to see what the PS5 Pro’s ray tracing capabilities can achieve as games get bigger and better looking across the board.</p>\n<div  class=\"fancy-box\"><div class=\"fancy_box-title\">PS5 Pro review: The TechRadar Gaming verdict</div><div class=\"fancy_box_body\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure \"  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"dfqtKEssDARNoPnWoU4dTi\" name=\"1730829646.jpg\" caption=\"\" alt=\"The PS5 Pro console on a wooden desk in front of a white brick background and next to a potted plant\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dfqtKEssDARNoPnWoU4dTi.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pinterest-pin-exclude\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class=\"fancy-box__body-text\">Our Managing Editor, Rob Dwiar, spent some time with the PS5 Pro pre-launch, and gave his verdict in the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5-pro-review\" target=\"_blank\">TechRadar Gaming PS5 Pro review</a>.

There's also a whole host of PS4 and PS5 games that'll benefit from what Sony is calling PS5 Pro Game Boost (as per the PS Blog):\"With the PS5 Pro version of the Game Boost feature, you can enjoy faster and smoother frame rates in some of the PS4 and PS5 console’s greatest games.\"This is said to apply to at least 8,500 PS4 and PS5 titles, so there are plenty of changes and upgrades on the way to the games you already own if you do choose to pick up a PS5 Pro. In addition, PS5 Pro will significantly enhance PSVR 2 games according to Mark Cerny.\nPS5 Pro enhanced games - what's the difference?\n\nAs part of the initial PS5 Pro technical presentation, we saw a few games running on the new hardware, highlighting the differences relative to the base PS5 console. Each enhanced game benefits from the new specs in different ways, but they all pull from the improvements below:\nUpgraded GPU with 67% more compute units and 28% faster memory; resulting in 45% faster renderingAdvanced ray-tracingAI-driven upscaling known as PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR)2TB SSDPS5 Pro Game BoostOptional disc-driveVRR and 8K gaming support\n(Image credit: PlayStation)\nIn our PS5 Pro review, we came to the conclusion that the main attraction is really “the convergence of graphical fidelity and performance with games now able to tap into the PS5 Pro’s hardware and features to shine in both ways - at the same time”. This boosted graphical fidelity is, more often than not, on par with the Quality Modes of the base PS5, but with a much smoother experience thanks to 60FPS or higher. This best of both worlds approach is really going to be the key difference moving forward, though it’s likely that we’ll see developers experiment further with higher end graphical settings that focus on ray tracing, or make use of the hardware’s new AI-boosted upscaling.Speaking on ray tracing, there have been significant advancements for many of the games now enhanced by the PS5 Pro.

This first-person single-player adventure puts us into the shoes of the titular explorer and shows brief spats of combat alongside some storytelling cinematics, and while a lot of the content of the game remains a mystery, this is a solid first look at what to expect.\n\nIn addition to this gameplay reveal, Bethesda shared a teaser trailer on Twitter in January 2021 that officially announced the new Indiana Jones game, though it had more Easter Eggs than actual information. The trailer pans across a desk covered with books, a camera, and papers before landing on Dr. Jones' signature fedora hat and whip. It's not much, but it's enough to get us excited. There seem to be plenty of clues lurking about, too.\npic.twitter.com/XSaIwjgiOFJanuary 12, 2021\nIf you want to keep your finger on the pulse of any new Indiana Jones and the Great Circle developments, keep an eye on the official Bethesda Twitter page.\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle story and setting\n(Image credit: MachineGames)\nGiven it's an Indiana Jones game we'll be able to expect an exciting, pulpy adventure full of brash heroism and relics of antiquity.Thankfully, the teaser and gameplay trailer do offer some useful tidbits that an enterprising viewer could use to piece together some parts of the plot. Given the trailer shows a map of Vatican City as well as writing that partly says, \"I will be arriving in Rome\", it looks like we'll see Dr. Jones adventuring in Italy, alongside the introductory cutscene of the trailer that suggests a brief stint in Africa.Given the fact that Indy's plane ticket is dated 1937, our hero may have to contend with the machinations of Italy's ascendant fascist party as Europe teeters on the brink of the Second World War. This also means that the game will be (at least partially) set a year after the first Indiana Jones movie: Raiders of the Lost Ark.The books of \"Ancient Circles\", \"Forbidden Stones\" and \"Myths that Made Us\" suggest that, in typical Indiana Jones fashion, the adventure will feature occult myths and ancient artifacts with supernatural powers.\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle FAQ\n(Image credit: MachineGames)\nWill Indiana Jones and the Great Circle be on PS5?\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch on PS5, just at a later date. You'll be able to play it on your PlayStation 5 sometime in Spring 2025. Stay tuned for updates.\nWho is the villain in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?\nEmmerich Voss is the main villain in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. He's a new villain to the series, and is allied with the Nazis as they attempt to track down historical objects of powerful significance. He's played by Marios Gavrilis, who has done German VO in games like Death Stranding, Gotham Knights and Starfield.\nWho voices Indiana Jones in the game?\nIndiana Jones is voiced by Troy Baker in the game. You'll recognise Troy from playing Joel in The Last of Us, Pagan Min in Far Cry 4, and Revolver Ocelot in Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain.\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle news\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle will come to PS5As announced during Gamescom 2024, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will come to PS5 in \"Spring 2025\".

Compiled natively for ARM64, this release enables users to easily sync and store files online from Windows PCs powered by Snapdragon,\" the company posted in a blog update.Although previous Google Drive apps have been available with versions prior to Windows 11, the ARM-based beta app is compatible exclusively with Microsoft’s flagship OS. It also requires Microsoft WebView2, which is usually preinstalled within the OS but could require users to download is separately during setup if that’s not the case.Google emphasized, because this is a beta product, some bugs may be present, therefore Snapdragon users should not rely on it until general availability is confirmed.
