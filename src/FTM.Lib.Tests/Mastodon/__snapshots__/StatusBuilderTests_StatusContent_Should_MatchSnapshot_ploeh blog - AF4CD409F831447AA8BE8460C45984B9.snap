Implementing rod-cutting

From pseudocode to implementation in three languages.
    
    
        This article picks up where Implementation and usage mindsets left off, examining how easy it is to implement an algorithm in three different programming languages.
    
    
        As an example, I'll use the bottom-up rod-cutting algorithm from Introduction to Algorithms.

        The problem is simple:
