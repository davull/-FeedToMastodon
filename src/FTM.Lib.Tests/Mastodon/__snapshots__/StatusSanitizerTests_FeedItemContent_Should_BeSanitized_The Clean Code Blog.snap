And so I thought that it might be wise to blog about my reasoning rather than to continue trying to cram that reasoning into tweets.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in doubt about what FP is, and about what OO is, and about whether the two are compatible, then I recommend <a href=\"http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2018/04/13/FPvsOO.html\">this</a> old blog of mine.</p>\n\n<p>What is a class? According to the dictionary a class is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>A set, collection, group, or configuration containing members regarded as having certain attributes or traits in common; a kind or category.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now consider that definition when reading the next paragraph.</p>\n\n<p>In OO languages we organize our programs into classes of objects that share similar traits.  We describe those objects in terms of the attributes and behaviors that they have in common.  We strive to create hierarchies of classification that those objects can fit within.  We consider the higher level classifications to be abstractions that allow the expression of general truths that are independent of irrelevant details.  (Indeed, I once defined abstraction as: <em>The Amplification of the essential, and the elimination of the irrelevant.</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Object-Oriented-Applications-Method/dp/0132038374\">[1]</a>)</p>\n\n<p>In 1966 the power of abstraction by classification led the authors of Simula to create the keyword <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">class</code>.  In 1980, Bjarne Stroustrup continued that convention and used the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">class</code> keyword in C++.  This was actually somewhat strange because C already had the keyword <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">struct</code> which had a virtually identical meaning.  But the power of the word <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">class</code> held sway.</p>\n\n<p>In the mid 90s the power of that word led the authors of Java (and then C#) to declare <em>and enforce</em> that <em>everything</em> in a program must be part of a class.  This was a dramatic overreach.  It seems to me that some of the things that Java forces into classes ought not to be in classes at all.  For example, the class <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">java.lang.Math</code> is really just a namespace for a batch of functions and is not, in any sense, a classification of objects.</p>\n\n<p>This conflation of object classification and namespaces is confusing and unnecessary; and is probably part of the reason my initial tweet generated the responses that it did.</p>\n\n<p>Another overreach in Java (and by extension C#) is that methods are polymorphic by default.  Polymorphism is a tool, not a rule.  Many, if not most, function calls do not require dynamic dispatch.</p>\n\n<p>These kinds of overreach lead to confusion about what a class really is.  I believe that most of the responses to my tweet were the result of that confusion.</p>\n\n<p>So let’s cut to the chase.</p>\n\n<p>One of the oldest rules of software design is that we should partition the elements of the system into loosely coupled and internally cohesive elements.  Those elements become well named places where we can put data and behavior.  This follows the old proverb: <em>A place for everything, and everything in its place.</em></p>\n\n<p>What are those elements?  It seems obvious that the classification structures of objects ought to be high on the list.  Namespaced function libraries like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">java.lang.Math</code> are another obvious choice.  In the one case we have a batch of functions that manipulate an internal data structure.  In the other case we have a batch of functions that manipulate an external data structure.</p>\n\n<p>The essential charachteristic of these elements, these batches of functions, is that they are internally cohesive.  That means that all the functions in the batch are strongly related to each other because they manipulate the same data structures, whether internal or external.  It is that cohesion that drives the partitioning of a software design.</p>\n\n<p>###Example</p>\n\n<p>Recently I have been writing an application called <a href=\"http://github.com/unclebob/more-speech\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">more-speech</code></a> which is a client that browses messages on the <a href=\"https://nostr.com\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nostr</code></a> network.  This nework is composed of relays that use a simple websocket protocol to transmit messages to clients.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">more-speech</code> client is written in Clojure, which is a Functional Programming language.</p>\n\n<p>Early on I created a module named <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">protocol</code> to house the code that implemented the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nostr</code> protocol.  I began this module by managing the websockets over which the messages travelled, and then decoding those messages and manipulating them according to the rules of the protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Clojure is not a traditional OOPL, there is no <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">class</code> keyword that is used to declare and define objects and the methods that manipulate them.  Rather, a module in Clojure is just a batch of functions that are not syntactically bound to any particular data.  Thus my <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">protocol</code> module had functions that dealt with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WebSocket</code>s and functions that dealth with messages and functions that dealth with protocol elements.  They were cohesive in the sense that they were all related to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nostr</code> protocol; but there was no central data structure that unified them.</p>\n\n<p>The other day I realized that I was missing an abstraction.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nostr</code> protocol may be transmitted over websockets but the protocol rules have nothing to do with websockets.  Those rules deal with the data that comes through the websockets, but not the websockets themselves.  Yet my <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">protocol</code> module was littered with websocket code.</p>\n\n<p>So I separated the websocket code from the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">protocol</code> code by creating an abstraction that I called <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">relay</code>.  A <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">relay</code> is a data structure that contains the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">url</code> of a websocket, the websocket itself, and a function to call when messages are received.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">relay</code> data structure is manipulated by functions such as <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">make</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">open</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">close</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">send</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">relay</code> module very clearly defines a class of objects.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">protocol</code> constructs a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">relay</code> object for each of the urls in a list of active relays.  It <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">open</code>s those <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">relay</code>s and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">send</code>s messages to them.  Messages that are received are sent to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">protocol</code> through the callback functions that are passed into the function that constructs the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">relay</code> object.  In order to maintain the immutability and referential transparency constraints of Functional Programming, the functions that update the state of a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">relay</code> return a new instance of that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">relay</code>.</p>\n\n<p>###Lesson</p>\n\n<p>Java, C#, Ruby, and C++ all either enforce, or stronly encourage, the partitioning of systems into classes. Clojure does not; it is entirely agnostic about classes. The lesson that I learned from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">protocol</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">relay</code> is that I had not been paying enough attention to class structure when writing complex Clojure programs.  Instead, I had been allowing functions to accumulate in modules in a, more or less, ad hoc fashion – similar to the way one might program in C, Fortran, Basic, or even Assembler.  But that was lazy.  Objects exist in programs, and they can, and should, be classified.  So, from now on, I will be paying much more attention to the classification structure of the objects my systems.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>A place for everything, and everything in its place.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n",

Polymorphism is a tool, not a rule.  Many, if not most, function calls do not require dynamic dispatch.\n\nThese kinds of overreach lead to confusion about what a class really is.  I believe that most of the responses to my tweet were the result of that confusion.\n\nSo let’s cut to the chase.\n\nOne of the oldest rules of software design is that we should partition the elements of the system into loosely coupled and internally cohesive elements.  Those elements become well named places where we can put data and behavior.  This follows the old proverb: A place for everything, and everything in its place.\n\nWhat are those elements?  It seems obvious that the classification structures of objects ought to be high on the list.  Namespaced function libraries like java.lang.Math are another obvious choice.  In the one case we have a batch of functions that manipulate an internal data structure.  In the other case we have a batch of functions that manipulate an external data structure.\n\nThe essential charachteristic of these elements, these batches of functions, is that they are internally cohesive.  That means that all the functions in the batch are strongly related to each other because they manipulate the same data structures, whether internal or external.  It is that cohesion that drives the partitioning of a software design.\n\n###Example\n\nRecently I have been writing an application called more-speech which is a client that browses messages on the nostr network.  This nework is composed of relays that use a simple websocket protocol to transmit messages to clients.  The more-speech client is written in Clojure, which is a Functional Programming language.\n\nEarly on I created a module named protocol to house the code that implemented the nostr protocol.  I began this module by managing the websockets over which the messages travelled, and then decoding those messages and manipulating them according to the rules of the protocol.\n\nClojure is not a traditional OOPL, there is no class keyword that is used to declare and define objects and the methods that manipulate them.  Rather, a module in Clojure is just a batch of functions that are not syntactically bound to any particular data.  Thus my protocol module had functions that dealt with WebSockets and functions that dealth with messages and functions that dealth with protocol elements.  They were cohesive in the sense that they were all related to the nostr protocol; but there was no central data structure that unified them.\n\nThe other day I realized that I was missing an abstraction.  The nostr protocol may be transmitted over websockets but the protocol rules have nothing to do with websockets.  Those rules deal with the data that comes through the websockets, but not the websockets themselves.  Yet my protocol module was littered with websocket code.\n\nSo I separated the websocket code from the protocol code by creating an abstraction that I called relay.  A relay is a data structure that contains the url of a websocket, the websocket itself, and a function to call when messages are received.  The relay data structure is manipulated by functions such as make, open, close, and send.\n\nThis relay module very clearly defines a class of objects.  The protocol constructs a relay object for each of the urls in a list of active relays.  It opens those relays and sends messages to them.  Messages that are received are sent to protocol through the callback functions that are passed into the function that constructs the relay object.  In order to maintain the immutability and referential transparency constraints of Functional Programming, the functions that update the state of a relay return a new instance of that relay.\n\n###Lesson\n\nJava, C#, Ruby, and C++ all either enforce, or stronly encourage, the partitioning of systems into classes. Clojure does not; it is entirely agnostic about classes. The lesson that I learned from protocol and relay is that I had not been paying enough attention to class structure when writing complex Clojure programs.  Instead, I had been allowing functions to accumulate in modules in a, more or less, ad hoc fashion – similar to the way one might program in C, Fortran, Basic, or even Assembler.  But that was lazy.  Objects exist in programs, and they can, and should, be classified.  So, from now on, I will be paying much more attention to the classification structure of the objects my systems.\n\n\n  A place for everything, and everything in its place."

In so doing I discovered a very interesting bug.</p>\n\n<p>One of the changes I made was to populate the initial space with a few random bases scattered here and there.  This would allow the player some extra resources with which to battle the Klingons while building up a network of more bases.</p>\n\n<p>While I was playing the modified game, it crashed.  Hard.</p>\n\n<p>Now I wrote this with TDD, and I was very disciplined about the cleanliness of the code, and the test coverage.  So this was unexpected.

This can only happen if the two bases exist at the exact same location.</p>\n\n<p>Bases don't move around in this game, so there's no chance that two bases will accidentally slide on top of each other.  There is a very (very) minor chance that the random number generator will put two bases on top of each other at the start of the game; but the odds are so miniscule that didn't worry about it. In any case, this crash happened well into the game I was playing, so initial values could not have been the cause.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately it's pretty easy to hunt and peck around in the game, so I was quickly able to discover that the two bases in question were duplicates of each other.  Something in my code was duplicating bases!</p>\n\n<p>Well now that should't be too hard to find.  So I wrote a litte function that would examine the world and halt with a message if the world contained two bases at the same location.  I called this function in the main update loop, and sure enough after 20 minutes of play the program halted with my message.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately being able to detect <em>that</em> the duplication occurred did not tell me <em>where</em> it occurred.  So I laced the code with calls to my <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">check-for-duplicate-base</code> function.</p>\n\n<p>It took me a few tries because the problem was not in any of the obvious places.  So over a few hours I added more and more calls to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">check-for-duplicate-base</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually I found the culprit in a low frequency function named <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">klingons-steal-antimatter</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This function is called once per second.  It checks to see if any klingons are within <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">docking-distance</code> of a base, and if so it steals antimatter from that base.</p>\n\n<p>This explained why the crash took so long to create.  Most of the time it takes 20 minutes or so for a Klingon to move close enough to a base to start stealing.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I looked at the code and didn't see any obvious duplication.  So I wrote a unit test to check whether that function duplicated bases.  My test positioned a klingon near a base, called the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">klingons-steal-antimatter</code> function, and then checked the number of bases in the world.  The result: No duplication.</p>\n\n<p>Now, before I continue, let me describe the process I used in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">klingons-steal-antimatter</code> function.</p>\n\n<p>The function created a list of <em>thefts</em>.  A theft is a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[thief victim]</code> pair.  It used those pairs to create lists of all the thieves and victims, and separate lists of all the innocent klingons and all the unvictimized bases.</p>\n\n<p>Why?  Because this is a purely functional program.  In a purely functional program you cannot update the status of an object.  Instead you transformm old objects into new objects.  So when stealing antimatter from a base you must create a new base with less antimatter, and you must create a new klingon with more antimatter.  When you are done processing all the thefts you are left with a list of all the updated klingons, and a list of all the updated bases.</p>\n\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">world</code> contains a list of all the klingons and a list of all the bases.  In order to update the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">world</code> after processing the thefts you have to concatenate the updated bases with the unvictimized bases, and you have to concatenate the updated klingons with the innocent klingons.</p>\n\n<p>Got it?  Understand?  Good.</p>\n\n<p>As I pondered the code I realized that a base could be robbed by more than one klingon.  Klingons tend to slowly migrate towards bases and then steal from them.  Two or three or more could eventually manage to slide over to a base, like a pack of coyotes squabbling over a carcass.</p>\n\n<p>Now I already had a unit test that checked for this condition.  It created two klingons near one base and made sure that each klingon was able to steal from that base.  What that test did not do, however, was count the number of bases in the world when it was done.</p>\n\n<p>So I added a check.  <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">base-count =&gt; 1</code>.  Whoops, it came back with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">2</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now maybe you've already figured out why this happened.  But let me walk you through it.  My function identified two thefts: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[[k1 b] [k2 b]]</code>  It returned with the results of each theft. Let's say that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">k1</code> stole <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">a1</code> antimatter from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">b</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">k2</code> stole <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">a2</code> from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">b</code>.  What the function returned was <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[[k1+a1 b-a1] [k1+a2 b-a2]]</code>.  Note that the second theft in the list was <em>not</em> <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[k2+a2 b-a1-a2]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You've probably guessed the rest.  When I reassembled the world, I added all the bases that had been victims; and -- of course -- I added <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">b-a1</code> <em>and</em> <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">b-a2</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately I had lots of unit tests to fall back on.  Changing the algorithm was actually quite challenging, and required me to put all the klingons and bases into hashmaps keyed by their positions.  I won't bore you with the details.</p>\n\n<p>So I added unit tests to check for the duplications, saw them fail, and then gradually made them pass.  The unit tests allowed me to be sure that I was not breaking something else along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Now you might think this is just an esoteric little problem that you'll never encounter.  However, if you are writing functional programs, you <em>will</em> face this issue, and you'll likely face it a lot.  Dealing with immutable lists of objects means that when you update such a list you must recreate it.  If you are only updating <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">m</code> out of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code> elements of the list, you have to partition the original list into the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">m</code> elements you are changing and the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n-m</code> elements you are not changing; and then you have to concatenate the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">m</code> changed elements with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n-m</code> unchanged elements in order to create the updated list.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I thought you might find that interesting.</p>\n",

It created two klingons near one base and made sure that each klingon was able to steal from that base.  What that test did not do, however, was count the number of bases in the world when it was done.\n\nSo I added a check.  base-count => 1.  Whoops, it came back with 2.\n\nNow maybe you've already figured out why this happened.  But let me walk you through it.  My function identified two thefts: [[k1 b] [k2 b]]  It returned with the results of each theft. Let's say that k1 stole a1 antimatter from b, and k2 stole a2 from b.  What the function returned was [[k1+a1 b-a1] [k1+a2 b-a2]].  Note that the second theft in the list was not [k2+a2 b-a1-a2].\n\nYou've probably guessed the rest.  When I reassembled the world, I added all the bases that had been victims; and -- of course -- I added b-a1 and b-a2.\n\nFortunately I had lots of unit tests to fall back on.  Changing the algorithm was actually quite challenging, and required me to put all the klingons and bases into hashmaps keyed by their positions.  I won't bore you with the details.\n\nSo I added unit tests to check for the duplications, saw them fail, and then gradually made them pass.  The unit tests allowed me to be sure that I was not breaking something else along the way.\n\nNow you might think this is just an esoteric little problem that you'll never encounter.  However, if you are writing functional programs, you will face this issue, and you'll likely face it a lot.  Dealing with immutable lists of objects means that when you update such a list you must recreate it.  If you are only updating m out of n elements of the list, you have to partition the original list into the m elements you are changing and the n-m elements you are not changing; and then you have to concatenate the m changed elements with the n-m unchanged elements in order to create the updated list.\n\nAnyway, I thought you might find that interesting."

    "raw": "<p>When I was 15 or so, my father would drive me, and my best friend, Tim Conrad, to the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) sales office each Saturday.  This was a 30 min drive.  My father would drop us off in the morning and pick us up in the late afternoon.  He spend two hours in his car each Saturday hauling us around.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Thanks Dad!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tim and I would spend our day \"playing\" with the floor model of the PDP-8 they had at the office.  The office staff were very accommodating and accepting of our presence, and they helped us out if we needed any fresh rolls of teleprinter paper, or paper tape.</p>\n\n<p>Several years later, at the age of 20, I found myself working at Teradyne Applied Systems in Chicago.  The computer we used there was called an M365; but it was really just an upgraded PDP-8.  We used it to control lasers in order to trim electronic components to very precise values.</p>\n\n<p>Forty four years later, in May of 2015, I started playing with a cute little Lua environment on my iPad called <a href=\"https://codea.io/\">Codea</a>.  I wrote several fun little programs, like lunar lander, etc.  But then I thought: \"Wouldn't it be fun to write a PDP-8 Emulator?\"</p>\n\n<p>A few days/weeks later I had a nice little PDP-8 emulator running on my iPad.  I found some archived binary images of ancient paper tapes and managed to load them into my emulator.  This allowed me to run the suite of development tools that I had used back in those early days.</p>\n\n<p>Then Apple decided it didn't want people writing code on the Ipad that was not distributed through the App store, so they blocked the means by which Codea users could share source code.   Indeed, I couldn't even move Lua source code to my new iPads.  So the emulator was lost.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately I had put the last working version up on GitHub.</p>\n\n<p>At some point, Apple reopened the channel, perhaps due to a court case.  I discovered this a few weeks back, and loaded that old source code back into my iPad.  It worked like a champ.</p>\n\n<p>I made a few changes to deal with the bigger screen, and the faster processor, and then announced it on twitter.  I think many people have played with it since.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>You can get the emulator <a href=\"https://github.com/unclebob/PDP8EmulatorIpad\">here</a>.</strong>  You'll find a lot of good tutorial information, and several demonstration videos in that repository.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"euler-4\">Euler 4</h3>\n<p>As you may know I have a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmsuNLXeDr6Y1-a9ASu4mfxqDIgr-oaU6\">youtube series</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/Cleancoders/playlists\">cleancoders.com channel</a>, in which I walk through the problems in the <a href=\"https://projecteuler.net/\">Euler project</a> solving them in Clojure and then taking them to the max, Myth-buster style.</p>\n\n<p>Euler 4 is a simple little problem of finding the factors of palindromic numbers.  I quickly solved it in Clojure, and then I thought it would be fun to write a PDP-8 program to solve it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Down the rathole I went.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I used TDD to get the individual subroutines working.  Among the subroutines I wrote were single and double precision multiply and divide routines. (We didn't use the word \"functions\" back then.)  The poor PDP-8 could only add.  It couldn't even subtract.  Subtraction was accomplished by using twos-complement addition (let the reader understand;-)</p>\n\n<p>Was this fun?  Yes, at first it was kinda cool to reminisce, and to feel all the old knowledge and instincts come flooding back into my brain.  But once the \"novelty\" wore off, it stopped being fun, and just turned into work -- grinding, tedious, work.</p>\n\n<p>It took me several hours, over a period of a few days, but I got the blasted thing working.  It's not an experience I'd like to repeat.  Working on a PDP-8 is a <strong>PITA</strong>, even when with all the cheats I supply in my Emulator.</p>\n\n<p>Here, for your edification, is my solution to Euler 4 on a PDP-8.  This code solves the problem; but I'm quite sure it has some really nasty bugs anyway.  I am in no way proud of this code.  I'm just not willing to improve it.  If you study it you'll see just how awful it is.  I mean, among other sins I used truly naive algorithms for multiplying and dividing numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, be careful.  The lure of the rathole is very compelling.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>/EULER 4 SOLUTION\n\n        PZERO=20\n\n        *200\n    \nMAIN,   CLA\n        TLS\n        TAD SEED\n        ISZ SEED\n        CIA\n        JMS CALL\n        MKPAL\n    \n        JMS CALL\n        PRDOT\n\n        CLA\n        TAD MAXFAC\n        DCA FAC\n\nFACLUP, \n        CLA\n        TAD FAC\n        TAD K100\n        SMA CLA\n        JMP MAIN\n    \n        JMS CALL\n        DLOAD\n        DPAL\n        TAD FAC\n        CIA\n        JMS CALL\n        ISFAC\n        SKP\n        JMP GOTFAC\n    \n        CLA\n        TAD I OFP /OTHER FAC &gt; 999 TRY NEXT PAL.\n        TAD MAXFAC\n        SMA CLA\n        JMP MAIN\n        ISZ FAC\n        JMP FACLUP\n    \nGOTFAC,\n        CLA\n        TAD I OFP\n        TAD MAXFAC\n        SMA CLA\n        JMP MAIN\n\n        JMS CRLF\n        CLA\n        TAD FAC\n        CIA\n        JMS CALL\n        PRAC\n        JMS CALL\n        PRDOT\n        CLA\n        TAD I OFP\n        JMS CALL\n        PRAC\n        JMS CRLF\n        JMS CALL\n        DLOAD\n        DPAL\n        JMS CALL\n        PRDACC\n        JMS CRLF\n        HLT     \n\n        DECIMAL\nSEED,   -999\nMAXFAC, -999\n        OCTAL\nFAC,    0\nOFP,    OTHFAC+1\n\n        *400\n\n/MAKE A PALINDROMIC  NUMBER FROM A SEED.\n/ABC-&gt;ABCCBA IN DECIMAL IN DACC AND STORED IN DPAL\n\nMKPAL,  0\n        DCA DPAL+1\n        DCA DPAL\n        TAD DPAL+1\n        JMS CALL\n        DIV\n        K10\n        DCA WRK\n        TAD REM\n        DCA DIGS\n        TAD WRK\n        JMS CALL\n        DIV\n        K10\n        DCA DIGS+2\n        TAD REM\n        DCA DIGS+1\n        JMS CALL\n        DLOAD\n        DPAL\n        TAD K1000\n        JMS CALL\n        DMUL\n        JMS CALL\n        DSTORE\n        DPAL\n        CLA\n        TAD DIGS\n        JMS CALL\n        MUL\n        K10\n        TAD DIGS+1\n        JMS CALL\n        MUL\n        K10\n        TAD DIGS+2\n        DCA DWRK+1\n        DCA DWRK\n        JMS CALL\n        DLOAD\n        DPAL\n        JMS CALL\n        DADD\n        DWRK\n    \n        JMS CALL\n        DSTORE\n        DPAL\n        JMP I MKPAL\n    \n/SKIP IF AC IS A FACTOR OF DACC.

    "sanitized": "When I was 15 or so, my father would drive me, and my best friend, Tim Conrad, to the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) sales office each Saturday.  This was a 30 min drive.  My father would drop us off in the morning and pick us up in the late afternoon.  He spend two hours in his car each Saturday hauling us around.\n\n\n  Thanks Dad!\n\n\nTim and I would spend our day \"playing\" with the floor model of the PDP-8 they had at the office.  The office staff were very accommodating and accepting of our presence, and they helped us out if we needed any fresh rolls of teleprinter paper, or paper tape.\n\nSeveral years later, at the age of 20, I found myself working at Teradyne Applied Systems in Chicago.  The computer we used there was called an M365; but it was really just an upgraded PDP-8.  We used it to control lasers in order to trim electronic components to very precise values.\n\nForty four years later, in May of 2015, I started playing with a cute little Lua environment on my iPad called Codea.  I wrote several fun little programs, like lunar lander, etc.  But then I thought: \"Wouldn't it be fun to write a PDP-8 Emulator?\"\n\nA few days/weeks later I had a nice little PDP-8 emulator running on my iPad.  I found some archived binary images of ancient paper tapes and managed to load them into my emulator.  This allowed me to run the suite of development tools that I had used back in those early days.\n\nThen Apple decided it didn't want people writing code on the Ipad that was not distributed through the App store, so they blocked the means by which Codea users could share source code.   Indeed, I couldn't even move Lua source code to my new iPads.  So the emulator was lost.\n\nFortunately I had put the last working version up on GitHub.\n\nAt some point, Apple reopened the channel, perhaps due to a court case.  I discovered this a few weeks back, and loaded that old source code back into my iPad.  It worked like a champ.\n\nI made a few changes to deal with the bigger screen, and the faster processor, and then announced it on twitter.  I think many people have played with it since.\n\n\n  You can get the emulator here.  You'll find a lot of good tutorial information, and several demonstration videos in that repository.\n\n\nEuler 4\nAs you may know I have a youtube series on the cleancoders.com channel, in which I walk through the problems in the Euler project solving them in Clojure and then taking them to the max, Myth-buster style.\n\nEuler 4 is a simple little problem of finding the factors of palindromic numbers.  I quickly solved it in Clojure, and then I thought it would be fun to write a PDP-8 program to solve it.\n\n\n  Down the rathole I went.\n\n\nI used TDD to get the individual subroutines working.  Among the subroutines I wrote were single and double precision multiply and divide routines. (We didn't use the word \"functions\" back then.)  The poor PDP-8 could only add.  It couldn't even subtract.  Subtraction was accomplished by using twos-complement addition (let the reader understand;-)\n\nWas this fun?  Yes, at first it was kinda cool to reminisce, and to feel all the old knowledge and instincts come flooding back into my brain.  But once the \"novelty\" wore off, it stopped being fun, and just turned into work -- grinding, tedious, work.\n\nIt took me several hours, over a period of a few days, but I got the blasted thing working.  It's not an experience I'd like to repeat.  Working on a PDP-8 is a PITA, even when with all the cheats I supply in my Emulator.\n\nHere, for your edification, is my solution to Euler 4 on a PDP-8.  This code solves the problem; but I'm quite sure it has some really nasty bugs anyway.  I am in no way proud of this code.  I'm just not willing to improve it.  If you study it you'll see just how awful it is.  I mean, among other sins I used truly naive algorithms for multiplying and dividing numbers.\n\nAnyway, be careful.  The lure of the rathole is very compelling.\n\n/EULER 4 SOLUTION\n\n        PZERO=20\n\n        *200\n    \nMAIN,   CLA\n        TLS\n        TAD SEED\n        ISZ SEED\n        CIA\n        JMS CALL\n        MKPAL\n    \n        JMS CALL\n        PRDOT\n\n        CLA\n        TAD MAXFAC\n        DCA FAC\n\nFACLUP, \n        CLA\n        TAD FAC\n        TAD K100\n        SMA CLA\n        JMP MAIN\n    \n        JMS CALL\n        DLOAD\n        DPAL\n        TAD FAC\n        CIA\n        JMS CALL\n        ISFAC\n        SKP\n        JMP GOTFAC\n    \n        CLA\n        TAD I OFP /OTHER FAC > 999 TRY NEXT PAL.\n        TAD MAXFAC\n        SMA CLA\n        JMP MAIN\n        ISZ FAC\n        JMP FACLUP\n    \nGOTFAC,\n        CLA\n        TAD I OFP\n        TAD MAXFAC\n        SMA CLA\n        JMP MAIN\n\n        JMS CRLF\n        CLA\n        TAD FAC\n        CIA\n        JMS CALL\n        PRAC\n        JMS CALL\n        PRDOT\n        CLA\n        TAD I OFP\n        JMS CALL\n        PRAC\n        JMS CRLF\n        JMS CALL\n        DLOAD\n        DPAL\n        JMS CALL\n        PRDACC\n        JMS CRLF\n        HLT     \n\n        DECIMAL\nSEED,   -999\nMAXFAC, -999\n        OCTAL\nFAC,    0\nOFP,    OTHFAC+1\n\n        *400\n\n/MAKE A PALINDROMIC  NUMBER FROM A SEED.\n/ABC->ABCCBA IN DECIMAL IN DACC AND STORED IN DPAL\n\nMKPAL,  0\n        DCA DPAL+1\n        DCA DPAL\n        TAD DPAL+1\n        JMS CALL\n        DIV\n        K10\n        DCA WRK\n        TAD REM\n        DCA DIGS\n        TAD WRK\n        JMS CALL\n        DIV\n        K10\n        DCA DIGS+2\n        TAD REM\n        DCA DIGS+1\n        JMS CALL\n        DLOAD\n        DPAL\n        TAD K1000\n        JMS CALL\n        DMUL\n        JMS CALL\n        DSTORE\n        DPAL\n        CLA\n        TAD DIGS\n        JMS CALL\n        MUL\n        K10\n        TAD DIGS+1\n        JMS CALL\n        MUL\n        K10\n        TAD DIGS+2\n        DCA DWRK+1\n        DCA DWRK\n        JMS CALL\n        DLOAD\n        DPAL\n        JMS CALL\n        DADD\n        DWRK\n    \n        JMS CALL\n        DSTORE\n        DPAL\n        JMP I MKPAL\n    \n/SKIP IF AC IS A FACTOR OF DACC.

    "raw": "<p>Recently I wrote a cute little program for doing <em>Turtle Graphics</em>.  For those of you who don't know, turtle graphics were originally added to the LOGO language by Seymour Papert in the late 1960s.  He built a robot that he called a \"turtle\" that could hold a pen.  The robot had wheels and could move forwards and backwards, and could rotate left and right.  It could also raise and lower the pen.  When placed on a sheet of paper, the turtle could be commanded to draw interesting designs.</p>\n\n<p>Papert's goal was to teach children about programming.  As the years went by the robot got replaced with screens, and the turtle became an icon that could draw lines.  Children from the 70s until now have been enthralled by the simple commands for directing the turtle, and the elegant drawings they can make.</p>\n\n<p>For example, this is how you might draw a square:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>forward 100\nright 90\nforward 100\nright 90\nforward 100\nright 90\nforward 100\nright 90.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Recently I had a need to explore some interesting geometrical designs.  Turtle graphics would be perfect for my purposes.  So I wrote a turtle graphics processor in Clojure.  <a href=\"https://github.com/unclebob/Euler/tree/main/e2_Fibonacci/Turtle\">[code]</a></p>\n\n<p>I used the <a href=\"http://quil.info/\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">quil</code></a> framework which is based on the <a href=\"http://processing.org\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Processing</code></a> framework in Java. This framework makes it very easy to create simple GUIs in Clojure.</p>\n\n<p>Now consider the problem of the Turtle.  What is the type model for this object?  What fields does it have, and what constraints must be placed on those fields?</p>\n\n<p>Here was my solution to that problem, written in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">clojure/spec</code>.  As usual, in Clojure, you start at the bottom and read towards the top.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(s/def ::position (s/tuple number? number?))\n(s/def ::heading (s/and number? #(&lt;= 0 % 360)))\n(s/def ::velocity number?)\n(s/def ::distance number?)\n(s/def ::omega number?)\n(s/def ::angle number?)\n(s/def ::weight (s/and pos? number?))\n(s/def ::state #{:idle :busy})\n(s/def ::pen #{:up :down})\n(s/def ::pen-start (s/or :nil nil?\n                         :pos (s/tuple number? number?)))\n(s/def ::line-start (s/tuple number? number?))\n(s/def ::line-end (s/tuple number? number?))\n(s/def ::line (s/keys :req-un [::line-start ::line-end]))\n(s/def ::lines (s/coll-of ::line))\n(s/def ::visible boolean?)\n(s/def ::speed (s/and int? pos?))\n(s/def ::turtle (s/keys :req-un [::position\n                                 ::heading\n                                 ::velocity\n                                 ::distance\n                                 ::omega\n                                 ::angle\n                                 ::pen\n                                 ::weight\n                                 ::speed\n                                 ::lines\n                                 ::visible\n                                 ::state]\n                        :opt-un [::pen-start]))\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Now don't freak out at all the parentheses and colons.  In fact, for the moment, just ignore them.</p>\n\n<p>So, what is a turtle?  A turtle is a map whose required keys are as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">position</code> is the cartesian coordinate of the pen of the turtle.  If you look up towards the top you will see that a position is defined as a tuple containing two numbers.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">heading</code> is the direction that the turtle is pointing.  It will move in that direction if told to move forward.  Again, looking up towards the top you can see that a heading must be a number between 0 and 360.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">velocity</code> is a number that represents the speed at which the turtle will move across the screen.  This is used for animation, so that the user can actually watch the turtle travel across the screen.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">distance</code> is a number that represents the remaining distance that the turtle must traverse before the current command (either a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">forward</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">backwards</code> command) is complete.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">omega</code> is a number that represents the angular velocity of the turtle.  Again, this is for animation purposes, so that the user can watch the turtle rotate when given a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">right</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">left</code> command.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">angle</code> is a number that represents the number of degrees remaining to complete the current rotation command.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pen</code> is the state of the pen.  Looking up you can see that the state of the pen can be either <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">up</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">down</code>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">weight</code> is a positive number that represents the thickness of the line drawn by the pen.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">speed</code> is a positive integer that acts as a multiplier for both the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">velocity</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">omega</code> parameters.  This allows the user to speed up or slow down the animation.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lines</code> is a list of all the lines drawn by the turtle so far.  Looking up you can see that it is a collection of lines, and that lines are maps whose required keys are <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">line-start</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">line-end</code>, both of which are tuples of two numbers. (Yes, I suppose I should have created a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">point</code> type.)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">visible</code> is a boolean that determines whether the turtle itself should be visible while it is being animated.  If this is false, then all the user sees is the animated result of the turtle's movements.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">state</code> is either <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">busy</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">idle</code>.  This is used by the command processor.  When the turtle goes from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">busy</code> to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">idle</code> the next command is pulled from the command queue and executed.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It should be clear that this is a type model.  Most statically typed languages would not be able to capture all the constraints within this type model; though there are perhaps some that could.  However, this is not a static type model.  Clojure is not a statically typed language.  <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">clojure/spec</code> is a dynamic type definition language.</p>\n\n<p>What does that mean?  Probably the best way to explain that is to show you where that type model gets invoked.  Here's a simple example.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(defn make []\n  {:post [(s/assert ::turtle %)]}\n  {:position [0.0 0.0]\n   :heading 0.0\n   :velocity 0.0\n   :distance 0.0\n   :omega 0.0\n   :angle 0.0\n   :pen :up\n   :weight 1\n   :speed 5\n   :visible true\n   :lines []\n   :state :idle})\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This is the default constructor of the turtle.  Notice that it just loads up all the required fields into a map.

    "sanitized": "Recently I wrote a cute little program for doing Turtle Graphics.  For those of you who don't know, turtle graphics were originally added to the LOGO language by Seymour Papert in the late 1960s.  He built a robot that he called a \"turtle\" that could hold a pen.  The robot had wheels and could move forwards and backwards, and could rotate left and right.  It could also raise and lower the pen.  When placed on a sheet of paper, the turtle could be commanded to draw interesting designs.\n\nPapert's goal was to teach children about programming.  As the years went by the robot got replaced with screens, and the turtle became an icon that could draw lines.  Children from the 70s until now have been enthralled by the simple commands for directing the turtle, and the elegant drawings they can make.\n\nFor example, this is how you might draw a square:\n\nforward 100\nright 90\nforward 100\nright 90\nforward 100\nright 90\nforward 100\nright 90.\n\n\nRecently I had a need to explore some interesting geometrical designs.  Turtle graphics would be perfect for my purposes.  So I wrote a turtle graphics processor in Clojure.  [code]\n\nI used the quil framework which is based on the Processing framework in Java. This framework makes it very easy to create simple GUIs in Clojure.\n\nNow consider the problem of the Turtle.  What is the type model for this object?  What fields does it have, and what constraints must be placed on those fields?\n\nHere was my solution to that problem, written in clojure/spec.  As usual, in Clojure, you start at the bottom and read towards the top.\n\n(s/def ::position (s/tuple number? number?))\n(s/def ::heading (s/and number? #(<= 0 % 360)))\n(s/def ::velocity number?)\n(s/def ::distance number?)\n(s/def ::omega number?)\n(s/def ::angle number?)\n(s/def ::weight (s/and pos? number?))\n(s/def ::state #{:idle :busy})\n(s/def ::pen #{:up :down})\n(s/def ::pen-start (s/or :nil nil?\n                         :pos (s/tuple number? number?)))\n(s/def ::line-start (s/tuple number? number?))\n(s/def ::line-end (s/tuple number? number?))\n(s/def ::line (s/keys :req-un [::line-start ::line-end]))\n(s/def ::lines (s/coll-of ::line))\n(s/def ::visible boolean?)\n(s/def ::speed (s/and int? pos?))\n(s/def ::turtle (s/keys :req-un [::position\n                                 ::heading\n                                 ::velocity\n                                 ::distance\n                                 ::omega\n                                 ::angle\n                                 ::pen\n                                 ::weight\n                                 ::speed\n                                 ::lines\n                                 ::visible\n                                 ::state]\n                        :opt-un [::pen-start]))\n\n\nNow don't freak out at all the parentheses and colons.  In fact, for the moment, just ignore them.\n\nSo, what is a turtle?  A turtle is a map whose required keys are as follows:\n\n\n  \n    position is the cartesian coordinate of the pen of the turtle.  If you look up towards the top you will see that a position is defined as a tuple containing two numbers.\n  \n  \n    heading is the direction that the turtle is pointing.  It will move in that direction if told to move forward.  Again, looking up towards the top you can see that a heading must be a number between 0 and 360.\n  \n  \n    velocity is a number that represents the speed at which the turtle will move across the screen.  This is used for animation, so that the user can actually watch the turtle travel across the screen.\n  \n  \n    distance is a number that represents the remaining distance that the turtle must traverse before the current command (either a forward or backwards command) is complete.\n  \n  \n    omega is a number that represents the angular velocity of the turtle.  Again, this is for animation purposes, so that the user can watch the turtle rotate when given a right or left command.\n  \n  \n    angle is a number that represents the number of degrees remaining to complete the current rotation command.\n  \n  \n    pen is the state of the pen.  Looking up you can see that the state of the pen can be either up or down.\n  \n  \n    weight is a positive number that represents the thickness of the line drawn by the pen.\n  \n  \n    speed is a positive integer that acts as a multiplier for both the velocity and omega parameters.  This allows the user to speed up or slow down the animation.\n  \n  \n    lines is a list of all the lines drawn by the turtle so far.  Looking up you can see that it is a collection of lines, and that lines are maps whose required keys are line-start and line-end, both of which are tuples of two numbers. (Yes, I suppose I should have created a point type.)\n  \n  \n    visible is a boolean that determines whether the turtle itself should be visible while it is being animated.  If this is false, then all the user sees is the animated result of the turtle's movements.\n  \n  \n    state is either busy or idle.  This is used by the command processor.  When the turtle goes from busy to idle the next command is pulled from the command queue and executed.\n  \n\n\nIt should be clear that this is a type model.  Most statically typed languages would not be able to capture all the constraints within this type model; though there are perhaps some that could.  However, this is not a static type model.  Clojure is not a statically typed language.  clojure/spec is a dynamic type definition language.\n\nWhat does that mean?  Probably the best way to explain that is to show you where that type model gets invoked.  Here's a simple example.\n\n(defn make []\n  {:post [(s/assert ::turtle %)]}\n  {:position [0.0 0.0]\n   :heading 0.0\n   :velocity 0.0\n   :distance 0.0\n   :omega 0.0\n   :angle 0.0\n   :pen :up\n   :weight 1\n   :speed 5\n   :visible true\n   :lines []\n   :state :idle})\n\n\nThis is the default constructor of the turtle.  Notice that it just loads up all the required fields into a map. Notice also that there is a post condition that asserts that the result conforms the the turtle type.\n\nThis is nice.  If I forget to initialize a field, or if I initialize a field to a value that conflicts with the type, I get an error.\n\nHere's another, more complex example.  Don't freak out, you don't have to understand this in detail.\n\n(defn update-turtle [turtle]\n  {:post [(s/assert ::turtle %)]}\n  (if (= :idle (:state turtle))\n    turtle\n    (let [{:keys [distance\n                  state\n                  angle\n                  lines\n                  position\n                  pen\n                  pen-start] :as turtle}\n          (-> turtle\n              (update-position)\n              (update-heading))\n          done? (and (zero? distance)\n                     (zero? angle))\n          state (if done? :idle state)\n          lines (if (and done? (= pen :down))\n                  (conj lines (make-line turtle))\n                  lines)\n          pen-start (if (and done? (= pen :down))\n                      position\n                      pen-start)]\n      (assoc turtle :state state :lines lines :pen-start pen-start)))\n  )\n\n\nThis is the function that updates the turtle for each screen refresh.  Again, notice the post condition.  If anything is calculated incorrectly by the update-turtle function, I'll get an exception right away.\n\nNow some of you might be worried that by checking types at runtime I could end up with runtime errors in production.  You might therefore assert that static typing is better because the compiler checks the types long before the program ever executes.\n\nHowever, I do not intend to have runtime errors in production, because I have a suite of tests that exercise all the behaviors of the system.  Here's just one of those tests:\n\n(describe \"Turtle Update\"\n  (with turtle (-> (t/make) (t/position [1.0 1.0]) (t/heading 1.0)))\n  (context \"position update\"\n    (it \"holds position when there's no velocity\"\n      (let [turtle (-> @turtle (t/velocity 0.0) (t/state :idle))\n            new-turtle (t/update-turtle turtle)]\n        (should= turtle new-turtle)))\n\n\nAgain, you don't have to understand this in any detail.  Just notice that the make and update-turtle functions are being invoked.  Since those functions have post conditions that will check the types, and since my suite of tests is exhaustive, I am quite certain that there will be no runtime errors in production and that my dynamic type checking is as robust as any static type system.\n\nThe dynamic nature of the type checking allows me to assert type constraints that are very difficult, if not impossible, to assert at compile time.  I can, for example, assert complex relationships between the values of the fields.\n\nTo expand on that example, imagine the type model of an accounting balance sheet.  The sum of the assets, liabilities and equities on the balance sheet must be zero.

It is up to me to decide if and when a certain type should be checked.  This gives me a lot of power and flexibility.  It allows me to violate the type rules in the midst of computations, so long as the end result ends up conforming to the types.\n\nOne last point.

The existing system ran on a great big GE Datanet 30.  ASC wanted to reimplement it on a Varian 620F mini-computer.</p>\n\n<p>The 620F was a lovely little 16 bit computer with 32K of core memory and a 1us cycle time.  The primary IO devices were a teletype, a slow card reader, two magnetic tape drives, and two 2314 20MB disks.  The machine also had 16 (or was it 32) RS232 ports for talking to teletypes that were remotely connected through 300BPS modems.</p>\n\n<p>Although the 620F came with a stand-alone assembler, there was no operating system.  So every bit of that real time union accounting system was built from assembler code, with no frameworks, platforms, or operating systems to help.</p>\n\n<p>In 1973 I took a job at Chicago Laser Systems, programming a PDP-8-like machine, in assembler, to control pulsed lasers, galvonometer driven mirrors, and step-and-repeat tables to trim electronic components to high degrees of tolerance.</p>\n\n<p>In 1975 I took a job at Outboard Marine Corporation, programming a real time aluminum die cast system in IBM System 7 assembler.</p>\n\n<p>In 1977 I took a job at Teradyne Central, programming a PDP-8-like machine, in assembler (again), to control a distributed system for testing and monitoring the quality of all the telephone lines in a telephone company service area.  A year later we started using 8085 micro-computers and wrote all that code in assembler too.</p>\n\n<p>Suffice it to say that I was steeped in assembler, and thought that all high-level languages were a joke. My forays into COBOL, Fortran, and PL/1 did not convince me otherwise.  Real programmers programmed in assembler.</p>\n\n<p>Between 1977 and 1980 I was introduced to Pascal.  I rejected it as a viable language almost immediatly.

I spent many years writing in that wonderful language which, by the way, was as untyped as assembler.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, that's not to say that C didn't have declared types.  It's just that the compiler didn't bother to check that you were using those types properly.  This made the language untyped for all intents and purposes.</p>\n\n<p>In 1986, after several nightmare scenarios having to do with the typlessness of C, I was an enthusiastic early adopter of C++.  Unfortunately I could not get my hands on a C++ compiler until 1987.  I became quite an expert in the languge, and engaged in many (many (many)) arguments on comp.lang.c++ and comp.object (in those heady days of USENET, a very early social networking platform).</p>\n\n<p>C++ is a statically typed language.  Many, today, would consider it to be relatively weakly typed; but from my point of view, after a decade and a half of untyped languages, I thought the type enforcement was very strong.  I had overcome the feeling of being handcuffed by a strong type system and became quite adept at building type models.</p>\n\n<p>In 1990 I took a contracting job at Rational, working in C++ on the first release of Rational Rose.  This is where I met Grady Booch, and came up with the plan for my first book.</p>\n\n<p>By 1991 I was a consultant, selling my services to companies, all over the US and Europe, who wanted to learn about object-oriented programming and C++.  It was a lucrative affair for me, and I continued building that business for several years. Eventually I became the editor-in-chief of <em>The C++ Report</em> (does anybody remember print magazines?)</p>\n\n<p>In 1999 I realized that C++ was a waning technolgy, and that the action was really happening in Java.  Java was similar enough to C++ for me to make the transition with relative ease.  The type system of Java was a bit weaker than C++, and I refused to use the stronger features (like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">final</code> though I had been an avid consumer of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">const</code> in C++).</p>\n\n<p>By 2003 I had grown tired of Java's static type system and started playing around with Python.  I found the language to be primitive and somewhat haphazard; so after a few excursions with the language I switched to Ruby.</p>\n\n<p>In Ruby I found a home for several years.  The dynamic type system was robust.  The object-oriented facilities were well thought through and very easy to use.  It was an elegant language with very few warts.</p>\n\n<p>Then, in 2010 or so, I bumped into Clojure.  I had just recently read <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html\"><em>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em></a> and so was interested in playing around with a LISP derivative.</p>\n\n<p>It has been 11 years now, and I feel no urge to change languages.  I reckon that Clojure may be my last programming language.  Oh, not that I haven't looked around.  I've had some daliances with Golang, Elixr, and Kotlin, and have looked with trepidation at Haskel.  I've even played with Scala and F#.  I keep looking as new languages arise; but have found nothing that calls me to switch away from Clojure.</p>\n\n<p>Notice the pathway of my career.  I went from untyped languages like assembler and C, to statically typed languages like C++ and Java, to dynamically typed languages like Python and Ruby, and now to Clojure.</p>\n\n<p>The type system in Clojure is as dynamic as Python or Ruby, but there is a library in Clojure called <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">clojure/spec</code> that provides all the strong typing anyone would ever need.  However, instead of that typing being controlled by the compiler, it is controlled by <em>me</em>.  I can enforce simple types, or very complex data relationships.  You might think of it as a kind of pre-condition/post-condition language.  Eifel programmers would feel very much at home with it.  It's an almost perfect way to engage in Design by Contract.</p>\n\n<p>So what do I conclude from this?  Not much other than that static typing is not for me.  I prefer the flexibility of dynamic typing, and the ability to enforce types if, and when, I need such enforcement.</p>\n\n",

I spent many years writing in that wonderful language which, by the way, was as untyped as assembler.\n\nOh, that's not to say that C didn't have declared types.  It's just that the compiler didn't bother to check that you were using those types properly.  This made the language untyped for all intents and purposes.\n\nIn 1986, after several nightmare scenarios having to do with the typlessness of C, I was an enthusiastic early adopter of C++.  Unfortunately I could not get my hands on a C++ compiler until 1987.  I became quite an expert in the languge, and engaged in many (many (many)) arguments on comp.lang.c++ and comp.object (in those heady days of USENET, a very early social networking platform).\n\nC++ is a statically typed language.  Many, today, would consider it to be relatively weakly typed; but from my point of view, after a decade and a half of untyped languages, I thought the type enforcement was very strong.  I had overcome the feeling of being handcuffed by a strong type system and became quite adept at building type models.\n\nIn 1990 I took a contracting job at Rational, working in C++ on the first release of Rational Rose.  This is where I met Grady Booch, and came up with the plan for my first book.\n\nBy 1991 I was a consultant, selling my services to companies, all over the US and Europe, who wanted to learn about object-oriented programming and C++.  It was a lucrative affair for me, and I continued building that business for several years. Eventually I became the editor-in-chief of The C++ Report (does anybody remember print magazines?)\n\nIn 1999 I realized that C++ was a waning technolgy, and that the action was really happening in Java.  Java was similar enough to C++ for me to make the transition with relative ease.  The type system of Java was a bit weaker than C++, and I refused to use the stronger features (like final though I had been an avid consumer of const in C++).\n\nBy 2003 I had grown tired of Java's static type system and started playing around with Python.  I found the language to be primitive and somewhat haphazard; so after a few excursions with the language I switched to Ruby.\n\nIn Ruby I found a home for several years.  The dynamic type system was robust.  The object-oriented facilities were well thought through and very easy to use.  It was an elegant language with very few warts.\n\nThen, in 2010 or so, I bumped into Clojure.  I had just recently read The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs and so was interested in playing around with a LISP derivative.\n\nIt has been 11 years now, and I feel no urge to change languages.  I reckon that Clojure may be my last programming language.  Oh, not that I haven't looked around.  I've had some daliances with Golang, Elixr, and Kotlin, and have looked with trepidation at Haskel.  I've even played with Scala and F#.  I keep looking as new languages arise; but have found nothing that calls me to switch away from Clojure.\n\nNotice the pathway of my career.  I went from untyped languages like assembler and C, to statically typed languages like C++ and Java, to dynamically typed languages like Python and Ruby, and now to Clojure.\n\nThe type system in Clojure is as dynamic as Python or Ruby, but there is a library in Clojure called clojure/spec that provides all the strong typing anyone would ever need.  However, instead of that typing being controlled by the compiler, it is controlled by me.  I can enforce simple types, or very complex data relationships.  You might think of it as a kind of pre-condition/post-condition language.  Eifel programmers would feel very much at home with it.  It's an almost perfect way to engage in Design by Contract.\n\nSo what do I conclude from this?  Not much other than that static typing is not for me.  I prefer the flexibility of dynamic typing, and the ability to enforce types if, and when, I need such enforcement."

I think we should consider <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/why-every-element-of-solid-is-wrong\">Dan North’s position on SOLID</a> – “Just write simple code.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I wrote the following letter in response:</p>\n\n<p>The SOLID principles remain as relevant to day as they were in the 90s (and indeed before that).  This is because software hasn’t changed all that much in all those years — and <strong>that</strong> is because software hasn’t change all that much since 1945 when Turing wrote the first lines of code for an electronic computer.  Software is still <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">if</code> statements, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">while</code> loops, and assignment statements — <em>Sequence</em>, <em>Selection</em>, and <em>Iteration</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Every new generation likes to think that their world is vastly different from the generation before.  Every new generation is wrong about that; which is something that every new generation learns once the next new generation comes along to tell them how much everything has changed. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">&lt;grin&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>So let’s walk through the principles, one by one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SRP</strong>) The Single Responsibility Principle.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Gather together the things that change for the same reasons.  Separate things that change for different reasons.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is hard to imagine that this principle is not relevant in software.  We do not mix business rules with GUI code.  We do not mix SQL queries with communications protocols.  We keep code that is changed for different reasons separate so that changes to one part to not break other parts.  We make sure that modules that change for different reasons do not have dependencies that tangle them.</p>\n\n<p>Microservices do not solve this problem.  You can create a tangled microservice, or a tangled set of microservices if you mix code that changes for different reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Dan North’s slides completely miss the point on this, and convinces me that he did not understand the principle at all.  (or that he was being ironic, which knowing Dan, is far more likely)  His answer to the SRP is to “Write Simple Code”.  I agree.  The SRP is one of the ways we keep the code simple.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OCP</strong>) The Open-Closed Principle.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>A Module should be open for extension but closed for modification.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of all the principles, the idea that anyone would question this one fills me full of dread for the future of our industry.  Of course we want to create modules that can be extended without modifying them.  Can you imagine working in a system that did not have device independence, where writing to a disk file was fundamentally different than writing to a printer, or a screen, or a pipe?  Do we want to see <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">if</code> statement scattered through our code to deal with all the little details?</p>\n\n<p>Or…  Do we want to separate abstract concepts from detailed concepts.  Do we want to keep business rules isolated from the nasty little details of the GUI, and the micro-service communications protocols, and the arbitrary behaviors of the database?  Of course we do!</p>\n\n<p>Again, Dan’s slide gets this completely wrong.  When requirements change only <em>part</em> of the existing code is wrong.  Much of the existing code is still right.  And we want to make sure that we don’t have to change the right code just to make the wrong code work again.  Dan’s answer is “write simple code”.  Again, I agree.  And, ironically, he is right.  <em>Simple code is both open and closed</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>LSP</strong>) The Liskov Substitution Principle.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>A program that uses an interface must not be confused by an implementation of that interface.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>People (including me) have made the mistake that this is about inheritance.  It is not.  It is about sub-typing.  All implementations of interfaces are subtypes of an interface.  All duck-types are subtypes of an implied interface.  And, every user of the base interface, whether declared or implied, must agree on the meaning of that interface.  If an implementation confuses the user of the base type, then <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">if/switch</code> statements will proliferate.</p>\n\n<p>This principle is about keeping abstractions crisp and well-defined.  It is impossible to believe that this is an outmoded concept.</p>\n\n<p>Dan’s slides are entirely correct on this topic; he simply missed the point of the principle.  Simple code is code that maintains crisp subtype relationships.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ISP</strong>) The Interface Segregation Principle.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Keep interfaces small so that users don’t end up depending on things they don’t need.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We still work with compiled languages.  We still depend upon modification dates to determine which modules should be recompiled and redeployed.  So long as this is true we will have to face the problem that when module A depends on module B at <em>compile</em> time, but not at run time, then changes to module B will force recompilation and redeployment of module A.</p>\n\n<p>This issue is especially acute in statically typed languages like Java, C#, C++, GO, Swift, etc.  Dynamicaly typed languages are affected much less; but are still not immune.  The existence of Maven and Leiningen are proof of that.</p>\n\n<p>Dan’s slide on this topic is provably false.  Clients <em>do</em> depend on methods they don’t call, if they have to be recompiled and redeployed when one of those methods is modified.  Dan’s final point on this principle is fine, so far as it goes.  Yes, if you can split a class with two interfaces into two separate classes, then it is a good idea to do so (SRP).  But such separation is often not feasible, nor even desirable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DIP</strong>) The Dependency Inversion Principle.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Depend in the direction of abstraction. High level modules should not depend upon low level details.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is hard to imagine an architecture that does not make significant use of this principle.  We do not want our high level business rules depending upon low level details.  I hope that is perfectly obvious.  We do not want the computations that make money for us polluted with SQL, or low level validations, or formatting issues.  We want isolation of the high level abstractions from the low level details.  That separation is achieved by carefully managing the dependencies within the system so that all source code dependencies, especially those that cross architectural boundaries, point towards high level abstractions, not low level details.</p>\n\n<p>In every case Dan’s slides end with: <em>Just write simple code</em>.  This is good advice.  However, if the years have taught us anything it is that simplicity requires disciplines guided by principles.  It is those principles that define simplicity.  It is those disciplines that constrain the programmers to produce code that leans towards simplicity.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to make a complicated mess is to tell everyone to “just be simple” and give them no further guidance.</p>\n",

Every new generation is wrong about that; which is something that every new generation learns once the next new generation comes along to tell them how much everything has changed. <grin>\n\nSo let’s walk through the principles, one by one.\n\nSRP) The Single Responsibility Principle.\n\n\n  Gather together the things that change for the same reasons.  Separate things that change for different reasons.\n\n\nIt is hard to imagine that this principle is not relevant in software.  We do not mix business rules with GUI code.  We do not mix SQL queries with communications protocols.  We keep code that is changed for different reasons separate so that changes to one part to not break other parts.  We make sure that modules that change for different reasons do not have dependencies that tangle them.\n\nMicroservices do not solve this problem.  You can create a tangled microservice, or a tangled set of microservices if you mix code that changes for different reasons.\n\nDan North’s slides completely miss the point on this, and convinces me that he did not understand the principle at all.  (or that he was being ironic, which knowing Dan, is far more likely)  His answer to the SRP is to “Write Simple Code”.  I agree.  The SRP is one of the ways we keep the code simple.\n\nOCP) The Open-Closed Principle.\n\n\n  A Module should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n\n\nOf all the principles, the idea that anyone would question this one fills me full of dread for the future of our industry.  Of course we want to create modules that can be extended without modifying them.  Can you imagine working in a system that did not have device independence, where writing to a disk file was fundamentally different than writing to a printer, or a screen, or a pipe?  Do we want to see if statement scattered through our code to deal with all the little details?\n\nOr…  Do we want to separate abstract concepts from detailed concepts.  Do we want to keep business rules isolated from the nasty little details of the GUI, and the micro-service communications protocols, and the arbitrary behaviors of the database?  Of course we do!\n\nAgain, Dan’s slide gets this completely wrong.  When requirements change only part of the existing code is wrong.  Much of the existing code is still right.  And we want to make sure that we don’t have to change the right code just to make the wrong code work again.  Dan’s answer is “write simple code”.  Again, I agree.  And, ironically, he is right.  Simple code is both open and closed.\n\nLSP) The Liskov Substitution Principle.\n\n\n  A program that uses an interface must not be confused by an implementation of that interface.\n\n\nPeople (including me) have made the mistake that this is about inheritance.  It is not.  It is about sub-typing.  All implementations of interfaces are subtypes of an interface.  All duck-types are subtypes of an implied interface.  And, every user of the base interface, whether declared or implied, must agree on the meaning of that interface.  If an implementation confuses the user of the base type, then if/switch statements will proliferate.\n\nThis principle is about keeping abstractions crisp and well-defined.  It is impossible to believe that this is an outmoded concept.\n\nDan’s slides are entirely correct on this topic; he simply missed the point of the principle.  Simple code is code that maintains crisp subtype relationships.\n\nISP) The Interface Segregation Principle.\n\n\n  Keep interfaces small so that users don’t end up depending on things they don’t need.\n\n\nWe still work with compiled languages.  We still depend upon modification dates to determine which modules should be recompiled and redeployed.  So long as this is true we will have to face the problem that when module A depends on module B at compile time, but not at run time, then changes to module B will force recompilation and redeployment of module A.\n\nThis issue is especially acute in statically typed languages like Java, C#, C++, GO, Swift, etc.  Dynamicaly typed languages are affected much less; but are still not immune.  The existence of Maven and Leiningen are proof of that.\n\nDan’s slide on this topic is provably false.  Clients do depend on methods they don’t call, if they have to be recompiled and redeployed when one of those methods is modified.  Dan’s final point on this principle is fine, so far as it goes.  Yes, if you can split a class with two interfaces into two separate classes, then it is a good idea to do so (SRP).  But such separation is often not feasible, nor even desirable.\n\nDIP) The Dependency Inversion Principle.\n\n\n  Depend in the direction of abstraction. High level modules should not depend upon low level details.\n\n\nIt is hard to imagine an architecture that does not make significant use of this principle.  We do not want our high level business rules depending upon low level details.  I hope that is perfectly obvious.  We do not want the computations that make money for us polluted with SQL, or low level validations, or formatting issues.  We want isolation of the high level abstractions from the low level details.  That separation is achieved by carefully managing the dependencies within the system so that all source code dependencies, especially those that cross architectural boundaries, point towards high level abstractions, not low level details.\n\nIn every case Dan’s slides end with: Just write simple code.  This is good advice.  However, if the years have taught us anything it is that simplicity requires disciplines guided by principles.  It is those principles that define simplicity.  It is those disciplines that constrain the programmers to produce code that leans towards simplicity.\n\nThe best way to make a complicated mess is to tell everyone to “just be simple” and give them no further guidance."

The state transition diagram looks like this.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/loopy/fsm.jpg\" width=\"300\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you look closely you can see the nested loops in that diagram.  They are the two transitions on the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Searching</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Factoring</code> states that stay in the same state.  You can also see the how the two loops interconnect through the transitions between the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Searching</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Factoring</code> states.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Starting</code> state simply accepts <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code> from the outside world and initializes <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">d</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">factors</code>, and then dispatches to one of the other three states as appropriate.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Done</code> state simply returns the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">factors</code> list.</p>\n\n<p>This is how Alan Turing envisioned computation in his <a href=\"https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf\">1936 paper</a>, which you can read about in Charles Petzold’s wonderful book: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Turing-Through-Historic-Computability/dp/0470229055\">The Annotated Turing</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, we’ve gone from a nice doubly nested loop in Java to a Turing style finite state machine simply through a sequence of refactorings, each of which kept all the tests passing.  This transformation from a standard procedure to a Turing style finite state machine could be done on any program at all.</p>\n\n<p>Now let’s go back to the two bits of code that started all this.  The Java version:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>public List&lt;Integer&gt; factorsOf(int n) {\n  ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; factors = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n\n  for (int d = 2; n &gt; 1; d++)\n    for (; n % d == 0; n /= d)\n      factors.add(d);\n\n  return factors;\n}\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>And the Clojure version:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(defn prime-factors [n]\n  (loop [n n d 2 factors []]\n          (if (&gt; n 1)\n            (if (zero? (mod n d))\n              (recur (/ n d) d (conj factors d))\n              (recur n (inc d) factors))\n            factors)))\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The finite state machine is entirely hidden in the Java version isn’t it.  It’s very difficult to see it peaking out from those nested <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">for</code> loops.  But that state machine is much more obvious in the Clojure program.  The state is determined by the two <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">if</code> forms, and the appropriate code is executed for each state.</p>\n\n<p>If you can’t see that FSM in the Clojure code, then consider this simple refactoring which makes it even more evident:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(defn factors [n]\n  (loop [n n d 2 fs []]\n    (cond\n      (and (not= n 1) (zero? (mod n d)))       (recur (/ n d) d (conj fs d))\n      (and (not= n 1) (not (zero? (mod n d)))) (recur n (inc d) fs)\n      (= n 1)                                  fs)))\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Why should this be?  Why should the Clojure program look more like the FSM than the Java program?  The answer is simple.  The Java program can save some state information <em>within</em> the flow of control, because it can mutate variables while the loops are in progress.  The Clojure program cannot save any state within the flow of control because no variables can be mutated at all.  Those state changes are only noticed when the recursive <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">loop</code> is re-entered.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, functional programs tend to look much more like Finite State Machines than programs that are free to manipulate variables.</p>\n\n<p>One last thought.  The Java program that implemented the Finite State Machine had only one loop; and that loop was: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">while</code> <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(true)</code>.  That means the loop knew nothing at all about the algorithm it was looping.  Thus we can abstract it away from the program itself and envision a language that has no loops at all.  No <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">while</code> statements, no <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">for</code> loops, no <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">if</code> statements, and (of course) no <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">goto</code>s.  Programs in this language would be written in the FSM style.  They would be composed of switch statements that switched on boolean expressions that identified each state.  The language system would then simply execute that program, over and over, until told to stop.</p>\n\n<p>Such programs would be naturally functional.  For although they could mutate the state of variables, the mutated state would be irrelevant to the flow of control within the program, and could only affect the next iteration of the program.  In effect the program would look like a tail-call-optimized recursive function.</p>\n\n<p>Wait…  Did I miss the exit?</p>\n\n",
    "sanitized": "The following is a segment of a journey.  It has no obvious beginning point, nor does it actually end up anywhere.

We have transformed the code from a doubly nested loop, to a single loop, without affecting the algorithm.\n\nIs this always possible?\n\nIn other words: given a program with a nested loop, is there a way to write the same program with a single loop?\n\nThe answer to that is: Yes.\n\nThe fact that a bit of code executes within an inner loop could be encoded into a state variable.  The outer loop could then dispatch to that bit of code depending upon how that state variable is set.\n\nWe see that in the code above.  The state condition for the inner loop is n%d==0.  Indeed, I can extract that out as a explanatory variable to make my point clearer.  I can also extract n>1.\n\n  private List<Integer> factorsOf(int n, int d, List<Integer> factors) {\n    while (true) {\n      boolean factorsRemain = n > 1;\n      boolean currentDivisorIsFactor = n % d == 0;\n      if (factorsRemain) {\n        if (currentDivisorIsFactor) {\n          factors.add(d);\n          n /= d;\n        } else {\n          d++;\n        }\n      } else\n        return factors;\n    }\n  }\n\n\nNow all the looping decisions are made at the very top; and the if statements simply dispatch the flow of control to the right bits of code.\n\nThat nested if is a bit annoying. Let’s replace all that nesting with appropriate logic.\n\n  private List<Integer> factorsOf(int n, int d, List<Integer> factors) {\n    while (true) {\n      boolean factorsRemain = n > 1;\n      boolean currentDivisorIsFactor = n % d == 0;\n      if (factorsRemain && currentDivisorIsFactor) {\n          factors.add(d);\n          n /= d;\n      }\n      if (factorsRemain && !currentDivisorIsFactor)\n          d++;\n      if (!factorsRemain)\n        return factors;\n    }\n  }\n\n\nNow we have a nice outer loop that fully determines the execution path up front, and then selects the appropriate paths with a sequence of if statements with no else clauses.\n\nIndeed, we can improve upon this just a little bit more by using more explanatory variables to explicitly name those paths.\n\n  private List<Integer> factorsOf(int n, int d, List<Integer> factors) {\n    while (true) {\n      boolean factorsRemain = n > 1;\n      boolean currentDivisorIsFactor = n % d == 0;\n  \n      boolean factorOutCurrentDivisor = factorsRemain && \n                                        currentDivisorIsFactor;\n      boolean tryNextDivisor = factorsRemain && !currentDivisorIsFactor;\n      boolean allDone = !factorsRemain;\n  \n      if (factorOutCurrentDivisor) {\n        factors.add(d);\n        n /= d;\n      }\n      if (tryNextDivisor) {\n        d++;\n      }\n      if (allDone)\n        return factors;\n    }\n  }\n\n\nI think I can make this more interesting by using an enum and a switch.\n\n  private enum State {Starting, Factoring, Searching, Done}\n\n  private List<Integer> factorsOf(int n, int d, List<Integer> factors) {\n    State state = State.Starting;\n    while (true) {\n      boolean factorsRemain = n > 1;\n      boolean currentDivisorIsFactor = n % d == 0;\n\n      if (factorsRemain && currentDivisorIsFactor)\n        state = State.Factoring;\n      if (factorsRemain && !currentDivisorIsFactor)\n        state = State.Searching;\n      if (!factorsRemain)\n        state = State.Done;\n\n      switch (state) {\n        case Factoring:\n          factors.add(d);\n          n /= d;\n          break;\n        case Searching:\n          d++;\n          break;\n        case Done:\n          return factors;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n\nNow let’s move the determination of the next state into each case.\n\n  private List<Integer> factorsOf(int n, int d, List<Integer> factors) {\n    State state = State.Starting;\n    while (true) {\n      switch (state) {\n        case Starting:\n          if (n == 1)\n            state = State.Done;\n          else if (n % d == 0)\n            state = State.Factoring;\n          else\n            state = State.Searching;\n          break;\n        case Factoring:\n          factors.add(d);\n          n /= d;\n          if (n == 1)\n            state = State.Done;\n          else if (n % d != 0)\n            state = State.Searching;\n          break;\n        case Searching:\n          d++;\n          if (n == 1)\n            state = State.Done;\n          else if (n % d == 0)\n            state = State.Factoring;\n          break;\n        case Done:\n          return factors;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n\nUgh.  I think we can improve upon this by moving a few things around and gettting rid of those explanatory variables.\n\n  private List<Integer> factorsOf(int n, int d, List<Integer> factors) {\n    State state = State.Starting;\n    while (true) {\n      switch (state) {\n        case Starting:\n          break;\n        case Factoring:\n          factors.add(d);\n          n /= d;\n          break;\n        case Searching:\n          d++;\n          break;\n        case Done:\n          return factors;\n      }\n\n      if (n == 1)\n        state = State.Done;\n      else if (n % d == 0)\n        state = State.Factoring;\n      else\n        state = State.Searching;\n    }\n  }\n\n\nOK, So now the whole thing has been changed into a Moore model finite state machine. The state transition diagram looks like this.\n\n\n\nIf you look closely you can see the nested loops in that diagram.  They are the two transitions on the Searching and Factoring states that stay in the same state.  You can also see the how the two loops interconnect through the transitions between the Searching and Factoring states.  The Starting state simply accepts n from the outside world and initializes d and factors, and then dispatches to one of the other three states as appropriate.  The Done state simply returns the factors list.\n\nThis is how Alan Turing envisioned computation in his 1936 paper, which you can read about in Charles Petzold’s wonderful book: The Annotated Turing.\n\nSo, we’ve gone from a nice doubly nested loop in Java to a Turing style finite state machine simply through a sequence of refactorings, each of which kept all the tests passing.  This transformation from a standard procedure to a Turing style finite state machine could be done on any program at all.\n\nNow let’s go back to the two bits of code that started all this.  The Java version:\n\npublic List<Integer> factorsOf(int n) {\n  ArrayList<Integer> factors = new ArrayList<>();\n\n  for (int d = 2; n > 1; d++)\n    for (; n % d == 0; n /= d)\n      factors.add(d);\n\n  return factors;\n}\n\n\nAnd the Clojure version:\n\n(defn prime-factors [n]\n  (loop [n n d 2 factors []]\n          (if (> n 1)\n            (if (zero? (mod n d))\n              (recur (/ n d) d (conj factors d))\n              (recur n (inc d) factors))\n            factors)))\n\n\nThe finite state machine is entirely hidden in the Java version isn’t it.  It’s very difficult to see it peaking out from those nested for loops.  But that state machine is much more obvious in the Clojure program.  The state is determined by the two if forms, and the appropriate code is executed for each state.\n\nIf you can’t see that FSM in the Clojure code, then consider this simple refactoring which makes it even more evident:\n\n(defn factors [n]\n  (loop [n n d 2 fs []]\n    (cond\n      (and (not= n 1) (zero? (mod n d)))       (recur (/ n d) d (conj fs d))\n      (and (not= n 1) (not (zero? (mod n d)))) (recur n (inc d) fs)\n      (= n 1)                                  fs)))\n\n\nWhy should this be?  Why should the Clojure program look more like the FSM than the Java program?  The answer is simple.  The Java program can save some state information within the flow of control, because it can mutate variables while the loops are in progress.  The Clojure program cannot save any state within the flow of control because no variables can be mutated at all.  Those state changes are only noticed when the recursive loop is re-entered.\n\nThus, functional programs tend to look much more like Finite State Machines than programs that are free to manipulate variables.\n\nOne last thought.  The Java program that implemented the Finite State Machine had only one loop; and that loop was: while (true).  That means the loop knew nothing at all about the algorithm it was looping.  Thus we can abstract it away from the program itself and envision a language that has no loops at all.  No while statements, no for loops, no if statements, and (of course) no gotos.  Programs in this language would be written in the FSM style.  They would be composed of switch statements that switched on boolean expressions that identified each state.  The language system would then simply execute that program, over and over, until told to stop.\n\nSuch programs would be naturally functional.  For although they could mutate the state of variables, the mutated state would be irrelevant to the flow of control within the program, and could only affect the next iteration of the program.  In effect the program would look like a tail-call-optimized recursive function.\n\nWait…  Did I miss the exit?"

    "raw": "<p>So let’s learn just a little bit more of Clojure.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few common utility functions:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>user=&gt; (inc 1) ; increments argument\n2\nuser=&gt; (dec 3) ; decrements argument\n2\nuser=&gt; (empty?

[1 2])\nfalse\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If you know Java or C# you probably know what the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">map</code> function does.  Here’s an example: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(map inc [1 2 3])</code> evaluates to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(2 3 4)</code>.<br />\nThe first argument of map is a function.  The second is a list.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">map</code> function returns a new list by applying the function to every element of the input list.</p>\n\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">filter</code> function also takes a function and a list.  <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(filter odd? [1 2 3 4 5])</code> evaluates to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(1 3 5)</code>.  From that I think you can tell what both the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">filter</code> and the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">odd?</code> functions do.</p>\n\n<p>And so with that, let’s try a little challenge.  Let’s find all the prime numbers between one and a thousand.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll use a variant of TDD to do this.  Our eyes will be the tests.  The cycle will be the same size as normal TDD; but we’ll write a bit of code first and then test it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>I know.  Blashphemy!  So sue me.  ;-)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We begin like this: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(defn primes [n] )</code>  This returns <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nil</code>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>user=&gt; (primes 1000)\nnil\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Now let’s get all the numbers between 1 and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(defn primes [n]\n  (range 1 (inc n)))\n\nuser=&gt; (primes 10)\n(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>You’ve probably figured out what <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">range</code> does.  It just returns a list of all the integers between it’s arguments.</p>\n\n<p>OK, so now all we have to do is filter all the primes:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(defn primes [n]\n  (let [candidates (range 1 (inc n))]\n    (filter prime? candidates)))\n\nCompilerException java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to resolve symbol: prime? in this context, compiling:(null:3:5)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Oh, oh.  We need to implement <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">prime?</code></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(defn prime? [n])\n\nuser=&gt; (primes 10)\n()\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>OK, that makes sense.  But I should explain the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">let</code> function.  It allows you to create names that are bound to expressions.  The names exist only within the parentheses of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">let</code> expression.  So it’s a way to create local variables – though the word “variable” is not quite right because they cannot be reassigned.  They are immutable.</p>\n\n<p>Now how do we tell if a given integer <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code> is prime?  Well, you all know how to do that, right?  The simple and naive way is to divide the integer by every number between 2 and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code>.  But, of course that’s wasteful.  There’s a better upper limit to try which is the square root of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code>.  I’m sure you can work out why that’s true.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(defn prime? [n]\n  (let [sqrt (Math/sqrt n)]\n     sqrt))\n \nuser=&gt; (prime? 100)\n10.0\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>OK, that’s right.  Notice that we called the Java <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Math.sqrt</code> function.  That’s a good example of how Clojure can call down into the Java libraries).  Of course we don’t want <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">prime?</code> to return a number; we want it to return a boolean.  But for now it’s good to see the intermediate values of our computation.</p>\n\n<p>So, next we’d like to get all the integers between 2 and the square root.  We already know how to do that.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(defn prime? [n]\n  (let [sqrt (Math/sqrt n)\n        divisors (range 2 (inc sqrt))]\n     divisors))\n \n user=&gt; (prime? 100)\n (2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Now which of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">divisors</code>\tdivide <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code> evenly?  We can find out by using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">map</code> function.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(defn prime? [n]\n  (let [sqrt (Math/sqrt n)\n        divisors (range 2 (inc sqrt))\n        remainders (map (fn [x] (rem n x)) divisors)]\n   remainders))\n \nuser=&gt; (prime? 100)\n(0 1 0 0 4 2 4 1 0)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rem</code> function should be self-explanatory; it just returns the integer remainder of the division of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code> by <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">x</code>.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(fn [x]...)</code> business needs a little explanation.  Notice how similar it is to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">defn f [x]</code>?  This is how we create an anonymous function.  If you know the syntax in Java or C# for anonymous functions, then this shouldn’t be too much of a surprise to you.  Anyway, the remainders list is just the list of all the remainders that result from dividing <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code> by the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">divisors</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now some of those remainders were zero, and that means they divided <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code> evenly.  Therefore <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code> (100 in this case) is not prime.  Let’s try a few others.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>user=&gt; (prime? 17)\n(1 2 1 2)\nuser=&gt; (prime? 1001)\n(1 2 1 1 5 0 1 2 1 0 5 0 7 11 9 15 11 13 1 14 11 12 17 1 13 2 21 15 11 9 9)\nuser=&gt; (prime? 37)\n(1 1 1 2 1 2)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>OK, so if the remainders list has a zero in it, then <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code> is not prime.  Well, that should be easy, shouldn’t it?</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(defn prime? [n]\n  (let [sqrt (Math/sqrt n)\n        divisors (range 2 (inc sqrt))\n        remainders (map (fn [x] (rem n x)) divisors)\n        zeroes (filter zero? remainders)]\n     zeroes))\n \nuser=&gt; (prime? 100)\n(0 0 0 0)\nuser=&gt; (prime? 17)\n()\t \n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>So now all we need to do is return <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">true</code> if the list is empty.  Right?</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(defn prime? [n]\n  (let [sqrt (Math/sqrt n)\n        divisors (range 2 (inc sqrt))\n\t\tremainders (map (fn [x] (rem n x)) divisors)\n\t\tzeroes (filter zero? remainders)]\n     (empty? zeroes)))\n\nuser=&gt; (prime? 100)\nfalse\nuser=&gt; (prime? 17)\ntrue\nuser=&gt; (primes 100)\n(1 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97)\t\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Now I want you to think carefully about how we solved this problem.  No <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">if</code> statements.  No <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">while</code> loops.  Instead we envisioned lists of data flowing through filters and mappers.  The solution was almost more of a fluid dynamics problem than a software problem.  (Ok, that’s a stretch, but you get my meaning.)  Instead of imagining a procedural solution, we imagine a data-flow solution.</p>\n\n<p>Think hard on this – it is one of the keys to functional programming.</p>\n\n<p>(Special thanks to Stu Halloway @stuarthalloway for cluing me into the dataflow mindset way back in 2005)</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and the primes between 1 and 1000?</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>user=&gt; (primes 1000)\n(1 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 101 103 107 109 113 127 131 137 139 149 151 157 163 167 173 179 181 191 193 197 199 211 223 227 229 233 239 241 251 257 263 269 271 277 281 283 293 307 311 313 317 331 337 347 349 353 359 367 373 379 383 389 397 401 409 419 421 431 433 439 443 449 457 461 463 467 479 487 491 499 503 509 521 523 541 547 557 563 569 571 577 587 593 599 601 607 613 617 619 631 641 643 647 653 659 661 673 677 683 691 701 709 719 727 733 739 743 751 757 761 769 773 787 797 809 811 821 823 827 829 839 853 857 859 863 877 881 883 887 907 911 919 929 937 941 947 953 967 971 977 983 991 997)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>And, yes, there is a bug.  1 is not prime.  2 is prime.

It just returns a list of all the integers between it’s arguments.\n\nOK, so now all we have to do is filter all the primes:\n\n(defn primes [n]\n  (let [candidates (range 1 (inc n))]\n    (filter prime? candidates)))\n\nCompilerException java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to resolve symbol: prime? in this context, compiling:(null:3:5)\n\n\nOh, oh.  We need to implement prime?\n\n(defn prime? [n])\n\nuser=> (primes 10)\n()\n\n\nOK, that makes sense.  But I should explain the let function.  It allows you to create names that are bound to expressions.  The names exist only within the parentheses of the let expression.  So it’s a way to create local variables – though the word “variable” is not quite right because they cannot be reassigned.  They are immutable.\n\nNow how do we tell if a given integer n is prime?  Well, you all know how to do that, right?  The simple and naive way is to divide the integer by every number between 2 and n.  But, of course that’s wasteful.  There’s a better upper limit to try which is the square root of n.  I’m sure you can work out why that’s true.\n\n(defn prime? [n]\n  (let [sqrt (Math/sqrt n)]\n     sqrt))\n \nuser=> (prime? 100)\n10.0\n\n\nOK, that’s right.  Notice that we called the Java Math.sqrt function.  That’s a good example of how Clojure can call down into the Java libraries).  Of course we don’t want prime? to return a number; we want it to return a boolean.  But for now it’s good to see the intermediate values of our computation.\n\nSo, next we’d like to get all the integers between 2 and the square root.  We already know how to do that.\n\n(defn prime? [n]\n  (let [sqrt (Math/sqrt n)\n        divisors (range 2 (inc sqrt))]\n     divisors))\n \n user=> (prime? 100)\n (2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)\n\n\nNow which of the divisors\tdivide n evenly?  We can find out by using the map function.\n\n(defn prime? [n]\n  (let [sqrt (Math/sqrt n)\n        divisors (range 2 (inc sqrt))\n        remainders (map (fn [x] (rem n x)) divisors)]\n   remainders))\n \nuser=> (prime? 100)\n(0 1 0 0 4 2 4 1 0)\n\n\nThe rem function should be self-explanatory; it just returns the integer remainder of the division of n by x.  The (fn [x]...) business needs a little explanation.  Notice how similar it is to defn f [x]?  This is how we create an anonymous function.  If you know the syntax in Java or C# for anonymous functions, then this shouldn’t be too much of a surprise to you.  Anyway, the remainders list is just the list of all the remainders that result from dividing n by the divisors.\n\nNow some of those remainders were zero, and that means they divided n evenly.  Therefore n (100 in this case) is not prime.  Let’s try a few others.\n\nuser=> (prime? 17)\n(1 2 1 2)\nuser=> (prime? 1001)\n(1 2 1 1 5 0 1 2 1 0 5 0 7 11 9 15 11 13 1 14 11 12 17 1 13 2 21 15 11 9 9)\nuser=> (prime? 37)\n(1 1 1 2 1 2)\n\n\nOK, so if the remainders list has a zero in it, then n is not prime.  Well, that should be easy, shouldn’t it?\n\n(defn prime? [n]\n  (let [sqrt (Math/sqrt n)\n        divisors (range 2 (inc sqrt))\n        remainders (map (fn [x] (rem n x)) divisors)\n        zeroes (filter zero? remainders)]\n     zeroes))\n \nuser=> (prime? 100)\n(0 0 0 0)\nuser=> (prime? 17)\n()\t \n\n\nSo now all we need to do is return true if the list is empty.  Right?\n\n(defn prime? [n]\n  (let [sqrt (Math/sqrt n)\n        divisors (range 2 (inc sqrt))\n\t\tremainders (map (fn [x] (rem n x)) divisors)\n\t\tzeroes (filter zero? remainders)]\n     (empty? zeroes)))\n\nuser=> (prime? 100)\nfalse\nuser=> (prime? 17)\ntrue\nuser=> (primes 100)\n(1 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97)\t\n\n\nNow I want you to think carefully about how we solved this problem.  No if statements.  No while loops.  Instead we envisioned lists of data flowing through filters and mappers.  The solution was almost more of a fluid dynamics problem than a software problem.  (Ok, that’s a stretch, but you get my meaning.)  Instead of imagining a procedural solution, we imagine a data-flow solution.\n\nThink hard on this – it is one of the keys to functional programming.\n\n(Special thanks to Stu Halloway @stuarthalloway for cluing me into the dataflow mindset way back in 2005)\n\nOh, and the primes between 1 and 1000?\n\nuser=> (primes 1000)\n(1 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 101 103 107 109 113 127 131 137 139 149 151 157 163 167 173 179 181 191 193 197 199 211 223 227 229 233 239 241 251 257 263 269 271 277 281 283 293 307 311 313 317 331 337 347 349 353 359 367 373 379 383 389 397 401 409 419 421 431 433 439 443 449 457 461 463 467 479 487 491 499 503 509 521 523 541 547 557 563 569 571 577 587 593 599 601 607 613 617 619 631 641 643 647 653 659 661 673 677 683 691 701 709 719 727 733 739 743 751 757 761 769 773 787 797 809 811 821 823 827 829 839 853 857 859 863 877 881 883 887 907 911 919 929 937 941 947 953 967 971 977 983 991 997)\n\n\n\n  And, yes, there is a bug.  1 is not prime.  2 is prime.  Can you fix it?"

    "raw": "<p>So let’s learn just a little bit of clojure.</p>\n\n<p>This expression: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(1 2)</code> represents the list containing the integers 1 and 2 in that order.  If you want an empty list, that’s just <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">()</code>.  And the list of the first five letters of the alphabet is just <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(\\a \\b \\c \\d \\e)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now you know a lot about the syntax of clojure.  Perhaps you think there’s a lot missing.  Well, there are a <em>few</em> things missing; but far fewer than you’d think.</p>\n\n<p>You might be wondering how you add two numbers.  That’s easy, that’s just <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(+ 1 2)</code>.  As it happens that’s also just the list of the function named <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">+</code> followed by a 1 and a 2.  You see, a function call is really just a list.  The function is the first element of the list, and the arguments are just the other elements of that list.  When you want to call a function, you simply invoke the list that represents that function call.</p>\n\n<p>There are quite a few built-in functions in clojure.  For example there’s <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">+, -, *, and /</code>.  They do precisely what you’d think.  Well, perhaps not precisely.  <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(+ 1 2 3)</code> evaluations to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">6</code>.  <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(- 3 2 1)</code> evaluates to zero.  <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(* 2 3 4)</code> evaluates to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">24</code>.  And <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(/ 20 2 5)</code> evaluates to 2.  <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(- 5)</code> evaluates to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-5</code>.  <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(* 5)</code> evaluates to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">5</code>.  And, get ready for this, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(/ 3)</code> evaluates to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1/3</code>.  That last is the clojure syntax for the rational number one-third.</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(first 1 2 3)</code> evaluates to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(second 1 2 3)</code> evaluates to 2, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(last 1 2 3)</code> evaluates to – you guessed it – <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">3</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like to see this in action you’ll need to start up a clojure REPL.  You can google how to do that.  The word REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print Loop.  It’s a very simple program that reads in an expression, evaluates that expression, prints the result of that expression, and then loops back to the read.</p>\n\n<p>If you start a REPL you’ll get some kind of a prompt, perhaps like this <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">user=&gt;</code>.  Then you can type an expression and see it evaluated.  Here are a few from my REPL</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>user=&gt; (+ 1 2 3 4)\n10\nuser=&gt; (- 5 6 7 8)\n-16\nuser=&gt; (* 6 7 8)\n336\nuser=&gt; (/ 5 6 9)\n5/54\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If you try the expression at the very start of this article: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(1 2)</code> you’ll get a nasty surprise.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>user=&gt; (1 2)\nClassCastException java.lang.Long cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFn  user$eval1766.invokeStatic (:1)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>That’s because the digit <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1</code> is not a function; and the REPL believes that if it reads a list, that list ought to be evaluated as a function call.  If you just want the list <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(1 2)</code> at the REPL you can convince the REPL not to call the list as a function by quoting it as follows:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>user=&gt; (quote (1 2))\n(1 2)\nuser=&gt; '(1 2)\n(1 2)\nuser=&gt; (list 1 2)\n(1 2)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The first invokes the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">quote</code> function which prevents its argument <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(1 2)</code> from being evaluated and just returns it.  The second is just a little syntax shortcut for calling the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">quote</code> function.  The third invokes the function that constructs lists.</p>\n\n<p>Lists are implemented as linked lists.  Each element contains a value and points to the next element.  That makes it very fast to add an element to the front of the list, or to walk the list one element at a time.  But it makes it slow to index into the list to find the Nth element.  So, for that, clojure uses the <em>vector</em> data type.  Here is a vector of the first three integers: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[1 2 3]</code>.  That’s right, it’s the square brackets that do the trick.</p>\n\n<p>A vector is a lot like a growable array. It’s easy to add to the end of it, and it’s easy to index into it.  Lists make good stacks. Vectors make good queues.</p>\n\n<p>Now let’s define a function.  <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(defn f [x] (+ (* 3 x) 1))</code>  this defines the function named <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">f</code>.  It takes one argument named <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">x</code>.  And it calculates the formula: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">3x+1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now let’s take this apart one token at a time.  This looks like a call to the function <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">defn</code>.  We’ll let that stand for the moment, but it’s not exactly right; <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">defn</code> is a bit more special than that. The next token is the name of the function: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">f</code>.  Names are alphanumeric with a few special characters allowed.  For example <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">+++</code> is a valid name.  Following the name is a vector that names the function arguments.  Again, these are names.  Those names will be bound to the argument values when the function is called.  And following the argument vector is the expression that is evaluated by the function.  That expression can use the argument names.</p>\n\n<p>You now know the vast majority of Clojure syntax.  There’s more, of course, but you already know enough to write significant programs.</p>\n\n<p>So let’s write a simple one.  Let’s write the factorial function.<br /> \n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(defn fac [x] (if (= x 1) 1 (* x (fac (dec x)))))</code></p>\n\n<p>Let’s walk through this.  The function is named <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fac</code> and it takes one argument named <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">x</code>.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">if</code> function takes three arguments. If the first evaluates to something <em>truthy</em> it returns the second, otherwise it returns the third.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">=</code> function does exactly what you’d think: it is a test for equality.  If <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">x</code> is 1, then the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">if</code> statement, and therefore the function, will return 1.  Otherwise the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">if</code> statement will return <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">x</code> times the factorial of the decrement of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">x</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s try it:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>user=&gt; (fac 3)\n6\nuser=&gt; (fac 4)\n24\nuser=&gt; (fac 10)\n3628800\nuser=&gt; (fac 20)\n2432902008176640000\nuser=&gt; (fac 30)\n\nArithmeticException integer overflow  clojure.lang.Numbers.throwIntOverflow (Numbers.java:1501)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>That works nicely, until we exceed 64 bits of precision.  Clojure likes to use 64 bit integers for efficiency.  But if you’d rather have unlimited precision you can use the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">N</code> notation.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>user=&gt; (fac 1000N)\n402387260077093773543702433923003985719374864210714632543799910429938512398629020592044208486969404800479988610197196058631666872994808558901323829669944590997424504087073759918823627727188732519779505950995276120874975462497043601418278094646496291056393887437886487337119181045825783647849977012476632889835955735432513185323958463075557409114262417474349347553428646576611667797396668820291207379143853719588249808126867838374559731746136085379534524221586593201928090878297308431392844403281231558611036976801357304216168747609675871348312025478589320767169132448426236131412508780208000261683151027341827977704784635868170164365024153691398281264810213092761244896359928705114964975419909342221566832572080821333186116811553615836546984046708975602900950537616475847728421889679646244945160765353408198901385442487984959953319101723355556602139450399736280750137837615307127761926849034352625200015888535147331611702103968175921510907788019393178114194545257223865541461062892187960223838971476088506276862967146674697562911234082439208160153780889893964518263243671616762179168909779911903754031274622289988005195444414282012187361745992642956581746628302955570299024324153181617210465832036786906117260158783520751516284225540265170483304226143974286933061690897968482590125458327168226458066526769958652682272807075781391858178889652208164348344825993266043367660176999612831860788386150279465955131156552036093988180612138558600301435694527224206344631797460594682573103790084024432438465657245014402821885252470935190620929023136493273497565513958720559654228749774011413346962715422845862377387538230483865688976461927383814900140767310446640259899490222221765904339901886018566526485061799702356193897017860040811889729918311021171229845901641921068884387121855646124960798722908519296819372388642614839657382291123125024186649353143970137428531926649875337218940694281434118520158014123344828015051399694290153483077644569099073152433278288269864602789864321139083506217095002597389863554277196742822248757586765752344220207573630569498825087968928162753848863396909959826280956121450994871701244516461260379029309120889086942028510640182154399457156805941872748998094254742173582401063677404595741785160829230135358081840096996372524230560855903700624271243416909004153690105933983835777939410970027753472000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000N\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>OK, one last thing.  Let’s add up all the numbers in a list.  We want <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(sum [1 2 3 4 5])</code> to evaluate to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">15</code>.  First we’ll do it the hard way:<br />\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(defn sum [l] (if (empty? l) 0 (+ (first l) (sum (rest l)))))</code></p>\n\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">empty?</code> function does just what you’d think, it returns true if the list is empty.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rest</code> function returns all but the first element of a list.</p>\n\n<p>Of course we could have written <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sum</code> like this: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(defn sum [l] (apply + l))</code>.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">apply</code> function – um – applies the function passed in it’s first argument to the list in its second.</p>\n\n<p>We could also have written the function like this: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(defn sum [l] (reduce + l))</code>.  But that takes us to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">reduce</code> function which (as George Carlin used to say) might go a bit too far.  At least for this article.</p>\n\n",
    "sanitized": "So let’s learn just a little bit of clojure.\n\nThis expression: (1 2) represents the list containing the integers 1 and 2 in that order.

Perhaps you think there’s a lot missing.  Well, there are a few things missing; but far fewer than you’d think.\n\nYou might be wondering how you add two numbers.  That’s easy, that’s just (+ 1 2).  As it happens that’s also just the list of the function named + followed by a 1 and a 2.  You see, a function call is really just a list.  The function is the first element of the list, and the arguments are just the other elements of that list.  When you want to call a function, you simply invoke the list that represents that function call.\n\nThere are quite a few built-in functions in clojure.  For example there’s +, -, *, and /.  They do precisely what you’d think.  Well, perhaps not precisely.  (+ 1 2 3) evaluations to 6.  (- 3 2 1) evaluates to zero.  (* 2 3 4) evaluates to 24.  And (/ 20 2 5) evaluates to 2.  (- 5) evaluates to -5.  (* 5) evaluates to 5.  And, get ready for this, (/ 3) evaluates to 1/3.  That last is the clojure syntax for the rational number one-third.\n\n(first 1 2 3) evaluates to 1, (second 1 2 3) evaluates to 2, and (last 1 2 3) evaluates to – you guessed it – 3.\n\nIf you’d like to see this in action you’ll need to start up a clojure REPL.  You can google how to do that.  The word REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print Loop.  It’s a very simple program that reads in an expression, evaluates that expression, prints the result of that expression, and then loops back to the read.\n\nIf you start a REPL you’ll get some kind of a prompt, perhaps like this user=>.  Then you can type an expression and see it evaluated.  Here are a few from my REPL\n\nuser=> (+ 1 2 3 4)\n10\nuser=> (- 5 6 7 8)\n-16\nuser=> (* 6 7 8)\n336\nuser=> (/ 5 6 9)\n5/54\n\n\nIf you try the expression at the very start of this article: (1 2) you’ll get a nasty surprise.\n\nuser=> (1 2)\nClassCastException java.lang.Long cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFn  user$eval1766.invokeStatic (:1)\n\n\nThat’s because the digit 1 is not a function; and the REPL believes that if it reads a list, that list ought to be evaluated as a function call.  If you just want the list (1 2) at the REPL you can convince the REPL not to call the list as a function by quoting it as follows:\n\nuser=> (quote (1 2))\n(1 2)\nuser=> '(1 2)\n(1 2)\nuser=> (list 1 2)\n(1 2)\n\n\nThe first invokes the quote function which prevents its argument (1 2) from being evaluated and just returns it.  The second is just a little syntax shortcut for calling the quote function.  The third invokes the function that constructs lists.\n\nLists are implemented as linked lists.  Each element contains a value and points to the next element.  That makes it very fast to add an element to the front of the list, or to walk the list one element at a time.  But it makes it slow to index into the list to find the Nth element.  So, for that, clojure uses the vector data type.  Here is a vector of the first three integers: [1 2 3].  That’s right, it’s the square brackets that do the trick.\n\nA vector is a lot like a growable array. It’s easy to add to the end of it, and it’s easy to index into it.  Lists make good stacks. Vectors make good queues.\n\nNow let’s define a function.  (defn f [x] (+ (* 3 x) 1))  this defines the function named f.  It takes one argument named x.  And it calculates the formula: 3x+1.\n\nNow let’s take this apart one token at a time.  This looks like a call to the function defn.  We’ll let that stand for the moment, but it’s not exactly right; defn is a bit more special than that. The next token is the name of the function: f.  Names are alphanumeric with a few special characters allowed.  For example +++ is a valid name.  Following the name is a vector that names the function arguments.  Again, these are names.  Those names will be bound to the argument values when the function is called.  And following the argument vector is the expression that is evaluated by the function.  That expression can use the argument names.\n\nYou now know the vast majority of Clojure syntax.  There’s more, of course, but you already know enough to write significant programs.\n\nSo let’s write a simple one.  Let’s write the factorial function. \n(defn fac [x] (if (= x 1) 1 (* x (fac (dec x)))))\n\nLet’s walk through this.  The function is named fac and it takes one argument named x.  The if function takes three arguments. If the first evaluates to something truthy it returns the second, otherwise it returns the third.  The = function does exactly what you’d think: it is a test for equality.  If x is 1, then the if statement, and therefore the function, will return 1.  Otherwise the if statement will return x times the factorial of the decrement of x.\n\nLet’s try it:\n\nuser=> (fac 3)\n6\nuser=> (fac 4)\n24\nuser=> (fac 10)\n3628800\nuser=> (fac 20)\n2432902008176640000\nuser=> (fac 30)\n\nArithmeticException integer overflow  clojure.lang.Numbers.throwIntOverflow (Numbers.java:1501)\n\n\nThat works nicely, until we exceed 64 bits of precision.  Clojure likes to use 64 bit integers for efficiency.  But if you’d rather have unlimited precision you can use the N notation.\n\nuser=> (fac 1000N)\n402387260077093773543702433923003985719374864210714632543799910429938512398629020592044208486969404800479988610197196058631666872994808558901323829669944590997424504087073759918823627727188732519779505950995276120874975462497043601418278094646496291056393887437886487337119181045825783647849977012476632889835955735432513185323958463075557409114262417474349347553428646576611667797396668820291207379143853719588249808126867838374559731746136085379534524221586593201928090878297308431392844403281231558611036976801357304216168747609675871348312025478589320767169132448426236131412508780208000261683151027341827977704784635868170164365024153691398281264810213092761244896359928705114964975419909342221566832572080821333186116811553615836546984046708975602900950537616475847728421889679646244945160765353408198901385442487984959953319101723355556602139450399736280750137837615307127761926849034352625200015888535147331611702103968175921510907788019393178114194545257223865541461062892187960223838971476088506276862967146674697562911234082439208160153780889893964518263243671616762179168909779911903754031274622289988005195444414282012187361745992642956581746628302955570299024324153181617210465832036786906117260158783520751516284225540265170483304226143974286933061690897968482590125458327168226458066526769958652682272807075781391858178889652208164348344825993266043367660176999612831860788386150279465955131156552036093988180612138558600301435694527224206344631797460594682573103790084024432438465657245014402821885252470935190620929023136493273497565513958720559654228749774011413346962715422845862377387538230483865688976461927383814900140767310446640259899490222221765904339901886018566526485061799702356193897017860040811889729918311021171229845901641921068884387121855646124960798722908519296819372388642614839657382291123125024186649353143970137428531926649875337218940694281434118520158014123344828015051399694290153483077644569099073152433278288269864602789864321139083506217095002597389863554277196742822248757586765752344220207573630569498825087968928162753848863396909959826280956121450994871701244516461260379029309120889086942028510640182154399457156805941872748998094254742173582401063677404595741785160829230135358081840096996372524230560855903700624271243416909004153690105933983835777939410970027753472000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000N\n\n\nOK, one last thing.  Let’s add up all the numbers in a list.  We want (sum [1 2 3 4 5]) to evaluate to 15.  First we’ll do it the hard way:\n(defn sum [l] (if (empty? l) 0 (+ (first l) (sum (rest l)))))\n\nThe empty? function does just what you’d think, it returns true if the list is empty.  The rest function returns all but the first element of a list.\n\nOf course we could have written sum like this: (defn sum [l] (apply + l)).  The apply function – um – applies the function passed in it’s first argument to the list in its second.\n\nWe could also have written the function like this: (defn sum [l] (reduce + l)).  But that takes us to the reduce function which (as George Carlin used to say) might go a bit too far.  At least for this article."

However, when both the complaint and the response are so blatantly public, it seems to me that LF owes it to the observing community to explain their decision and describe the due process that was used to make it – including the decision to make the public response that undoubtedly caused harm to Mr. Wood.

Robby speaks English, with the inflection of a proper british butler, rather in the manner of Carson on Downton Abbey.  Dr. Morbius claims to have created the Robot; so he is clearly the programmer.</p>\n\n<p>Morbius is studious, austere, even dour.  He is not evil; but he is a hermit and does not particularly enjoy the company of others.  He is massively intelligent but quite anti-social.</p>\n\n<p>Now remember that this was the ’50s.

My wife is Mexican, and she found that her ancestry is very diverse.</p>\n\n<p>One of the services of 23andMe is that they offer to connect you to relatives who have also used 23andMe.  Using this service my wife found a second cousin whom she had never met, but whose extended family had overlapped with hers.  By email they were able to compare the names of aunts and uncles, and the towns where they lived.  The more they talked, the more they realized that the overlap with the extended families was large.</p>\n\n<p>Some years back I went through the effort of scanning all the old photo albums that we had created or inherited over the years.  From that trove of digitized pictures my wive was able to find a 50 year old photograph of that extended family, taken in a little town in Mexico.  She shared that photo with her relative who happened to be visiting that town at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>The relative showed the picture to her aunts, uncles, cousins, and they all started pointing to people that they recognized.  Many tears flowed as warm recollections were conveyed.  This is apparently the only surviving photograph of that extended family; and now they all have, and cherish, it.</p>\n\n<p>Now I want you to consider what made this possible.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>I scanned those pictures on a whim, using <a href=\"https://photomyne.com\">Photomyne</a> an iPhone app that makes scanning and cataloging old photos very easy.</li>\n  <li>My wife was able to find that picture using the Photos app on the Mac.</li>\n  <li>The software at 23andMe was able to find her distant relative.</li>\n  <li>Email and FaceTime allowed the two to communicate.</li>\n  <li>And the internet ran through it all.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Software.  It was software that drove the connection of all those people.  It was software that enabled the warm tears of recollection to flow.  It was software that provided the photo to the folks in that little town in Mexico, who had not seen the faces of their loved ones in 50 years.  It was Software.  It was you and I – the programmers who built the systems and the connections that made that miracle happen.</p>\n\n<p>Software is the circulatory system of our civilization.  Software digests, filters, and sorts the constituents of the information stream.  Software routes the necessary element of that stream to the right places.  Software is the heart, the lungs, the vessels, the liver and kidneys, and the digestive system of our civilization.  Nothing works anymore without software.  Our civilization could no longer survive without software.</p>\n\n<p>But software does more than support the survival of our civilization.  Software also supports those moments of joy that my wife and her relatives recently experienced.</p>\n\n<p>It is things like this that make me proud to be a programmer.  Without us, our civilization could not survive, and the warm connections between relatives and friends could not be made.</p>\n\n<p>It is things like this that also make me yearn for a deeper discipline and professionalism for our industry.  Too much depends upon us now.  We’re going to have to leave the wild west of software behind and civilize ourselves, so that the civilization we support will continue to prosper.</p>\n\n",

Using this service my wife found a second cousin whom she had never met, but whose extended family had overlapped with hers.  By email they were able to compare the names of aunts and uncles, and the towns where they lived.  The more they talked, the more they realized that the overlap with the extended families was large.\n\nSome years back I went through the effort of scanning all the old photo albums that we had created or inherited over the years.  From that trove of digitized pictures my wive was able to find a 50 year old photograph of that extended family, taken in a little town in Mexico.  She shared that photo with her relative who happened to be visiting that town at the moment.\n\nThe relative showed the picture to her aunts, uncles, cousins, and they all started pointing to people that they recognized.  Many tears flowed as warm recollections were conveyed.  This is apparently the only surviving photograph of that extended family; and now they all have, and cherish, it.\n\nNow I want you to consider what made this possible.\n\n\n  I scanned those pictures on a whim, using Photomyne an iPhone app that makes scanning and cataloging old photos very easy.\n  My wife was able to find that picture using the Photos app on the Mac.\n  The software at 23andMe was able to find her distant relative.\n  Email and FaceTime allowed the two to communicate.\n  And the internet ran through it all.\n\n\nSoftware.  It was software that drove the connection of all those people.  It was software that enabled the warm tears of recollection to flow.  It was software that provided the photo to the folks in that little town in Mexico, who had not seen the faces of their loved ones in 50 years.  It was Software.  It was you and I – the programmers who built the systems and the connections that made that miracle happen.\n\nSoftware is the circulatory system of our civilization.  Software digests, filters, and sorts the constituents of the information stream.  Software routes the necessary element of that stream to the right places.  Software is the heart, the lungs, the vessels, the liver and kidneys, and the digestive system of our civilization.  Nothing works anymore without software.  Our civilization could no longer survive without software.\n\nBut software does more than support the survival of our civilization.  Software also supports those moments of joy that my wife and her relatives recently experienced.\n\nIt is things like this that make me proud to be a programmer.  Without us, our civilization could not survive, and the warm connections between relatives and friends could not be made.\n\nIt is things like this that also make me yearn for a deeper discipline and professionalism for our industry.  Too much depends upon us now.  We’re going to have to leave the wild west of software behind and civilize ourselves, so that the civilization we support will continue to prosper."
