And some products say they'll help your child with a fundamental skill, like reading, but actually have a narrow scope, such as practicing the alphabet. </p><p>Radesky recommends that parents think about whether a so-called educational product is indeed better than a child's own imaginative play, which can help them develop critical skills. </p><p>\"Open-ended and pretend play is a really important process for kids to develop mental flexibility, their attention span, and their ability to do storytelling in their heads,\" Radesky says. </p><p>She also notes that educational claims aren't vetted by a regulatory body in the U.S., nor are the companies that make them required to provide proof substantiating those claims. </p><h2>Are there any safety or privacy concerns? </h2><p>Each tech device has its own safety and privacy considerations, which creates a lot of work for parents. A smartphone, for example, can give marketers, predators, and bullies a direct line to your child.

Even if you got a head start on holiday shopping during Black Friday, you might be looking at your list, checking it twice, and realizing you've still got a lot more gifts to cross off. We're now less than two weeks away from Christmas and with all the last minute shopping that many of us are doing, products might end up with delayed deliveries.Don't get stuck with nothing under the tree this year, as Amazon's made it easy to find products that will arrive by tomorrow. And if you want a hand, we sorted through the best deal at Amazon that are available to arrive next-day.How do I find products that arrive by Christmas?\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            Amazon makes it easy to find deals that ship the next-day with its delivery filters.\n            Credit: Mashable\n        \n    \nIf you don't want to read every product's listing to see when it will ship, Amazon has a filter for sorting deals. Along the sidebar, you can filter products by delivery day. That way you can find items that will arrive by tomorrow. And if you're in a super time crunch, you can even find same-day shipping available.Best next-day deal\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Amazon\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Amazon Echo Dot\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $22.99\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $49.99\n                                                                             Save $27.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nWhy we like itThe Amazon Echo device line-up is sprawling.

It's a gorgeous, 4K OLED canvas that you can hang up in your living room and turn into a work of art when you're finished watching your favorite shows and movies. It features a wide variety of art from Vincent van Gogh, Frida Kahlo, and other artists from the New York Museum of Modern Art. But you can also watch reality TV and action flicks on it, which is an amusing fact.

When closed, it functions like a normal smartphone so you can call and text, but the larger screen gives you plenty of room for apps, gaming, and whatever your heart desires. Plus, with Samsung's Galaxy AI features, you have access to a whole additional world of functionality, including photo editing tools that you'll love. </p><h2>Best smartwatch deal</h2><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div class=\"mx-auto w-64 md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                                                        <a class=\"block group\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/zJVmPe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=image&element_label=image&object_type=article&object_uuid=00oSg6NAnkCydhU9grijwwK&short_url=zJVmPe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"3\" data-ga-click>\n                                                                            <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00oSg6NAnkCydhU9grijwwK/images-3.fill.size_256x256.v1734109988.png\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra on white background\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\n                        \n                        <div class=\"block relative mx-14 group-hover:visible tooltip\">\n                    <span class=\"absolute invisible p-1 mt-2 text-xs text-center text-white group-hover:visible tooltiptext bg-gray-600/0 group-hover:bg-gray-600/100\">\n                        Opens in a new window\n                    </span>\n                        </div>\n                                            </a>\n                                <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                            <span class=\"pr-5 mt-1 text-xs text-gray-600 subtitle-2\">Credit: Samsung</span>\n                                    </div>\n                        </div>\n    <div class=\"pl-0 mt-3 w-full md:pr-10 md:pl-7 md:mt-0 md:w-2/3\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/zJVmPe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=title&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Watch%20Ultra&object_type=article&object_uuid=00oSg6NAnkCydhU9grijwwK&short_url=zJVmPe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\" class=\"block mb-5 text-xl font-bold leading-8 text-center md:text-2xl md:text-left hover:underline text-secondary-300\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra\" data-ga-position=\"3\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra\n                </a>\n                                        <div class=\"flex justify-between items-center py-0 md:space-x-2\">\n                <div class=\"md:w-2/3\" style=\"line-height: 0.75rem\">\n                                            <span class=\"text-sm font-bold\">$489.99</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"text-xs\"> at Samsung</span>\n                                                <br>\n                                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold line-through\">$649.99</span>\n                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold text-red-400\"> Save $160.00</span>\n                                                            </div>\n            </div>\n                                                    <a class=\"font-bold leading-6 text-center hover:underline\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/zJVmPe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=buy-button&element_label=Get%20Deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=00oSg6NAnkCydhU9grijwwK&short_url=zJVmPe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"Get Deal\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"3\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    <button class=\"inline-block px-5 mt-3 w-full font-sans text-base font-bold tracking-wide md:w-auto md:text-lg btn btn-secondary\">Get Deal</button>\n                </a>\n                        </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Tired of your Apple Watch?

And it's no secret that grocery prices are extremely steep. Not only will $100 worth of free groceries go a long way for someone in your life, but they can also get them delivered to their door on a day they dread going out to the store. For a limited time, you can save $15 on an Instacart gift card at Amazon. Just add the $100 gift card option to your cart and the savings will be applied automatically.</p><h2>Amazon Echo Buds</h2><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div class=\"mx-auto w-64 md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                                                        <a class=\"block group\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/9Zd28V?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=image&element_label=image&object_type=article&object_uuid=05Xfg0xkSAbinwH7NSoL8D9&short_url=9Zd28V&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click>\n                                                                            <img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05Xfg0xkSAbinwH7NSoL8D9/images-9.fill.size_188x256.v1734101267.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Echo Buds\" width=\"188\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\n                        \n                        <div class=\"block relative mx-14 group-hover:visible tooltip\">\n                    <span class=\"absolute invisible p-1 mt-2 text-xs text-center text-white group-hover:visible tooltiptext bg-gray-600/0 group-hover:bg-gray-600/100\">\n                        Opens in a new window\n                    </span>\n                        </div>\n                                            </a>\n                                <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                            <span class=\"pr-5 mt-1 text-xs text-gray-600 subtitle-2\">Credit: Amazon</span>\n                                    </div>\n                        </div>\n    <div class=\"pl-0 mt-3 w-full md:pr-10 md:pl-7 md:mt-0 md:w-2/3\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9Zd28V?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=title&element_label=Amazon%20Echo%20Buds&object_type=article&object_uuid=05Xfg0xkSAbinwH7NSoL8D9&short_url=9Zd28V&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\" class=\"block mb-5 text-xl font-bold leading-8 text-center md:text-2xl md:text-left hover:underline text-secondary-300\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Amazon Echo Buds\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    Amazon Echo Buds\n                </a>\n                                        <div class=\"flex justify-between items-center py-0 md:space-x-2\">\n                <div class=\"md:w-2/3\" style=\"line-height: 0.75rem\">\n                                            <span class=\"text-sm font-bold\">$24.99</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"text-xs\"> at Amazon</span>\n                                                <br>\n                                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold line-through\">$49.99</span>\n                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold text-red-400\"> Save $25.00</span>\n                                                            </div>\n            </div>\n                                                    <a class=\"font-bold leading-6 text-center hover:underline\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/9Zd28V?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=buy-button&element_label=Get%20Deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=05Xfg0xkSAbinwH7NSoL8D9&short_url=9Zd28V&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"Get Deal\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    <button class=\"inline-block px-5 mt-3 w-full font-sans text-base font-bold tracking-wide md:w-auto md:text-lg btn btn-secondary\">Get Deal</button>\n                </a>\n                        </div>\n</div>\n<p>While they may not offer noise cancellation like the previously released version, the 2023 Echo Buds sound great, last up to 20 hours with the charging case, are simple to use, pair seamlessly with other Alexa devices, and have a price tag that's hard to beat.

deeper level by testing your origins in over 2,600 global regions. You'll be able to connect with living relatives (if they've also taken an AncestryDNA test), so you can find long-lost cousins and uncles. Plus, you'll get insight into 40+ genetic traits, so you can see how your genes have influenced your appearance, fitness, sensory characteristics, and beyond &mdash;&nbsp;all from a spit sample. It's usually $119 per kit, but as of Dec. 13, you'll pay just $39 at Amazon. If you're at a loss for a gift idea this season, scoop this up.</p><h2>Sonos Era 100</h2><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div class=\"mx-auto w-64 md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                                                        <a class=\"block group\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/a0X5Al?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=image&element_label=image&object_type=article&object_uuid=05Xfg0xkSAbinwH7NSoL8D9&short_url=a0X5Al&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"4\" data-ga-click>\n                                                                            <img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05Xfg0xkSAbinwH7NSoL8D9/images-7.fill.size_177x256.v1734101267.jpg\" alt=\"Sonos Era 100 speaker in black\" width=\"177\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\n                        \n                        <div class=\"block relative mx-14 group-hover:visible tooltip\">\n                    <span class=\"absolute invisible p-1 mt-2 text-xs text-center text-white group-hover:visible tooltiptext bg-gray-600/0 group-hover:bg-gray-600/100\">\n                        Opens in a new window\n                    </span>\n                        </div>\n                                            </a>\n                                <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                            <span class=\"pr-5 mt-1 text-xs text-gray-600 subtitle-2\">Credit: Sonos</span>\n                                    </div>\n                        </div>\n    <div class=\"pl-0 mt-3 w-full md:pr-10 md:pl-7 md:mt-0 md:w-2/3\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/a0X5Al?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=title&element_label=Sonos%20Era%20100&object_type=article&object_uuid=05Xfg0xkSAbinwH7NSoL8D9&short_url=a0X5Al&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\" class=\"block mb-5 text-xl font-bold leading-8 text-center md:text-2xl md:text-left hover:underline text-secondary-300\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Sonos Era 100\" data-ga-position=\"4\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    Sonos Era 100\n                </a>\n                                        <div class=\"flex justify-between items-center py-0 md:space-x-2\">\n                <div class=\"md:w-2/3\" style=\"line-height: 0.75rem\">\n                                            <span class=\"text-sm font-bold\">$199.00</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"text-xs\"> at Amazon</span>\n                                                <br>\n                                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold line-through\">$249.00</span>\n                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold text-red-400\"> Save $50.00</span>\n                                                            </div>\n            </div>\n                                                    <a class=\"font-bold leading-6 text-center hover:underline\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/a0X5Al?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=buy-button&element_label=Get%20Deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=05Xfg0xkSAbinwH7NSoL8D9&short_url=a0X5Al&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"Get Deal\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"4\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    <button class=\"inline-block px-5 mt-3 w-full font-sans text-base font-bold tracking-wide md:w-auto md:text-lg btn btn-secondary\">Get Deal</button>\n                </a>\n                        </div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/sonos-era-speakers\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Launched last year</a> as a replacement for the now obsolete Sonos One, the Sonos Era 100 is capable of producing stereo sound on its own (unlike its predecessor). It also refreshed the controls on top with a capacitive volume control and a new button to turn off the voice assistant, has a slightly taller build, and added two tweeters. It's usually $249, but as of Dec. 13, you can snag it for just $199 at Amazon.

Bose's base QuietComfort headphones provide a more budget-friendly alternative — especially when they're on sale. The Bose QuietComfort headphones are down to $199.99 during Target's holiday countdown event. That saves you $150, for 43% off.Best gaming deal\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Sony\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    PlayStation 5 Slim Console (Digital Edition)\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $374.99\n                                                     at Target\n                                                \n                                                                                            $449.99\n                                                                             Save $75.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nWhy we like itAnytime the PS5 goes on sale, we're all eyes. While the Cyber Week sales on the console were limited and fleeting, Target is giving you one last chance to snag the device ahead of the holidays.

and its dimensions are 5.7 x 5.7 x 5.2 inches. On its round exterior, you'll find an action button, volume buttons, a mic-off button, a light-up ring, a power port, and a 3.5-millimeter audio output. With three distinct color options currently available at Amazon, this under-$100 device is sure to fit your home decor seamlessly.</p><p>Setting up the Echo is also seamless and you can use it within minutes. Indeed, the only things inside the package are the device itself, a power adapter, and two guides. The setup guide is highly visual, which is always a perk. To begin, you have to download the Alexa app and sign in. No, you don't need to have a <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/how-to-cancel-amazon-prime\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Prime account</a> to use an Amazon smart device (though its range of possibilities surely increases for those of us who are Prime members). Plug in the included power adapter into the Echo and then plug the Echo into a wall outlet. The light ring on the Echo will turn blue when it&rsquo;s on and then orange when Alexa greets you. Next, connect the Echo to your home WiFi network. The Alexa app will then walk you through the rest of the setup process, including customizing your \"wake word,\" mastering the pronunciation of your name, allowing access to phone contacts, and more.</p><div class=\"flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-echo-devices\" class=\"flex items-center text-secondary-300\">\n            <span class=\"ml-1\">The 10 best Echo devices to add to your smart home</span>\n            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current\"><use href=\"https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n<p>Once all that is ready, you're good to go.

smart living to a new level. Though this device is two years newer than the aforementioned Echo (4th Gen), it's actually $50 cheaper.</p><p>The Echo Dot weighs 10.7 ounces, a third of the size of the Echo, and its dimensions are 3.9 x 3.9 x 3.5 inches. This baby can easily fit on countertops, shelves, or nightstands. Similar to the Echo, it boasts an action button, a microphone-off button, volume controls, a light ring, and a power port. It pretty much comes with the same color options as the bigger Echo, except for its deep sea blue shade being slightly darker than the Echo's twilight blue shade. <em>Potayto, potahto</em>.</p><p>Setup is also a breeze with the Echo Dot. First, plug it into a wall outlet and open the Alexa app to start setup. (You&rsquo;ll need to download the Alexa app on your smartphone beforehand.) Once you open the app, select &ldquo;devices&rdquo; and then select the &ldquo;+&rdquo; icon. Follow the on-screen instructions from that point on and personalize the device to your liking.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-34.fill.size_2000x1500.v1694718382.jpg\" alt=\"The Amazon Echo Dot resting on a table alongside its cord and two instruction manuals for use\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-34.fill.size_800x600.v1694718382.jpg 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-34.fill.size_1400x1050.v1694718382.jpg 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-34.fill.size_2000x1500.v1694718382.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n\n\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2 subtitle-2 font-sans \">\n            <span class=\"normal-case text-gray-1000\">What you get when you order an Amazon Echo Dot.</span>\n            <span class=\"text-gray-600 credit\">Credit: Stacia Datskovska / Mashable</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2>Smarter, easier living features</h2><h3>Echo</h3><p>The Amazon <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/8ymgv?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=deals&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Echo&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&amp%3Bshort_url=8ymgv&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fdeals%2Fecho-vs-echo-dot&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&short_url=8ymgv&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Echo</a> functions as your personal butler and best friend. Since it's a smart speaker that connects to the Alexa Voice Service, you use it to do everything from playing the latest hits to purchasing some kitchen staples to killing your boredom with a round of <em>Jeopardy!</em> Advanced sound technology helps the Echo immediately respond to you and recognize your voice. In fact, during the setup process on the Alexa app, Echo learns your voice's cadences and pitch by making you repeat some sample prompts. Impressive.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-37.fill.size_346x750.v1694718383.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Alexa app's grocery list feature with images of grocery staples.\" width=\"346\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-37.fill.size_800x1734.v1694718383.png 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-37.fill.size_1400x3035.v1694718383.png 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-37.fill.size_2000x4336.v1694718383.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n\n\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2 subtitle-2 font-sans max-w-3xl text-center mx-auto\">\n            <span class=\"normal-case text-gray-1000\">You can tell Alexa exactly what to put on your grocery list and manage the items on your Alexa app.</span>\n            <span class=\"text-gray-600 credit\">Credit: Screenshot: Amazon</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><strong>Prompt response: </strong>Beamforming technology, noise-cancellation, and seven microphones will enable the Echo to hear you from your nearby location. Just speak the wake word and say commands like &ldquo;Alexa, find an Amazon Music playlist,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Alexa, call Dad&rdquo; for immediate assistance. Something to note: Your speaker does not by any means have to be called Alexa. Other fun options include Echo, Ziggy, or Santa. Referring to your device as that last option unlocks a whole new <em>Ho-Ho-Ho</em> personality for it. Another thing to note: Amazon is getting better about accessibility, in the form of Adaptive Listening. This feature, when enabled, essentially gives you more time to finish speaking &mdash; Alexa's way of accommodating speech patterns like stuttering.</p><p><strong>Beats master: </strong>Of course the Echo can play music, but it&rsquo;s more than a basic speaker. It comes with Dolby premium sound that fills a whole room &mdash; with deep bass and clear high notes alike. If you have two Echo devices in one room, you can actually tell one of them to \"play music everywhere,\" which will amplify sound to even higher levels and make for an actual at-home clubbing experience. Word of caution, however &mdash; Alexa didn't cooperate with me, strangely, when I tried to test out this feature. For those of us who are highly picky about music streaming services, Amazon lets you set default options which you can change at any time. Do you want Alexa to pick music from Apple Music but podcasts from Spotify? No problem, there's an option for that.</p><p><strong>Hands-free communication: </strong>If you need to message or call loved ones, the Echo has your back. You can use Alexa to communicate with people via phone or text on the Echo, without grabbing your smartphone. Plus, Alexa can also make household announcements across <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/black-friday-amazon-echo-deals-2023\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Amazon Echo</a> devices at home, so your family knows if dinner is ready or guests are arriving. Use the Drop-In feature to connect to other Amazon Echo devices or the Announcement feature to record cute messages in your own voice (accompanied by a range of sound effect offerings, including dinner bell, kiss, trumpet, as well as, a bit alarmingly, toilet flush and fart).</p><p><strong>Control smart devices: </strong>If you have other smart devices that work with Alexa, you can easily control them with Echo's Zigbee smart home hub. Just ask Alexa to dim the lights, adjust the room temperature, or turn on a compatible smart-plug-connected appliance. The best thing about this? You don&rsquo;t have to press any buttons, and you can even engineer routines for yourself ahead of time to set these processes in motion at a certain time in your home.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-39.fill.size_563x750.v1694718571.jpg\" alt=\"The 4th Gen Amazon Echo glowing with a blue color on the bottom while resting on a shelf\" width=\"563\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-39.fill.size_800x1067.v1694718571.jpg 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-39.fill.size_1400x1867.v1694718571.jpg 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-39.fill.size_2000x2667.v1694718571.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n\n\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2 subtitle-2 font-sans max-w-3xl text-center mx-auto\">\n            <span class=\"normal-case text-gray-1000\">The Echo can double as a night light</span>\n            <span class=\"text-gray-600 credit\">Credit: Stacia Datskovska / Mashable </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h3>Echo Dot</h3><p>Making the smart living switch isn&rsquo;t always budget-friendly, but the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/EvE7X?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=deals&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Echo%20Dot&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&amp%3Bshort_url=EvE7X&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fdeals%2Fecho-vs-echo-dot&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Dot&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&short_url=EvE7X&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><u>Echo Dot</u></a> is affordable and provides great voice control features. These features aren't all that different from what you get with the Echo. The only true upgrades are new motion sensors that let you touch-control the device, the 1.73-inch front-firing speaker (versus a woofer and tweeters), and \"Eero mesh network support so the Echo Dot can serve as a node for your Eero network if you use one,\"&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-echo-dot-5th-gen\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">according to our sister site, PCMag</a>. Use the Dot to receive reminders, save cookie recipes to your app for future reference, bask your room in a night light glow, communicate with friends and family, soothe yourself with some white noise, and beyond.</p><p><strong>Listening companion: </strong>We&rsquo;ve all tried the conventional speaker setup, which typically involves too many outlets and wires. Echo Dot offers the opposite experience for all your listening needs. You can use your voice to play music through streaming services, including Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Spotify. Plus, Audible and other media forms are available on the Echo Dot. Ask Alexa to find the perfect playlist or podcast, and you&rsquo;ll have something to listen to when you cook in the kitchen, lounge on the couch, or work out in your living room. Another extra-cool feature? The Dot will start playing deep sleep music when it detects sounds of snoring &mdash; if you enable it to do so.</p><p><strong>Task help: </strong>There are times we wish that we had a personal assistant for little things, including making lists and scheduling calendars. The Echo Dot helps make your everyday routine (and entertainment) more seamless with voice control. Try saying: \"Alexa, set a timer for five minutes,\" \"Alexa, play the Reuters news briefing,\" \"Alexa, open my daily horoscope,\" or \"Alexa, find my phone.\" The possibilities are endless. Be sure to reference the \"more\" tab on the Alexa app to browse through all of the Echo Dot's offerings.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-36.fill.size_346x750.v1694718383.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Alexa Blueprints the Echo Dot is able to carry out.\" width=\"346\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-36.fill.size_800x1734.v1694718383.png 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-36.fill.size_1400x3035.v1694718383.png 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX/images-36.fill.size_2000x4336.v1694718383.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n\n\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2 subtitle-2 font-sans max-w-3xl text-center mx-auto\">\n            <span class=\"normal-case text-gray-1000\">Use the Dot to send messages to houseguests, remind you of tasks, and more!</span>\n            <span class=\"text-gray-600 credit\">Credit: Screenshot: Amazon</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><strong>Converse with and check in on loved ones: </strong>Like the Echo, the Echo Dot allows you to send messages, make phone calls, and use other Echo devices as intercoms.

Also, if you enable sound detection routines, you can program a particular sound (dog barking, oven dinging, door opening) to trigger a certain Alexa Routine. This feature has an accessibility bonus since it can be used as a way to provide visual cues to those with hearing challenges.

Still, with the Dot's new-and-improved front-firing speaker, there's no question that it wins the contest when it comes to quality audio. Also, with its upgraded temperature and movement sensors, the Dot seems to be leading the smart home game.

That's why now, on the Alexa app, you can review your daily voice history and delete anything you don't vibe with, manage the access to data certain skills have, and more. On the exterior of both the 4th Gen Echo and 5th Gen Echo Dot, you can also find a mic-off button that will prevent any audio input from reaching Alexa.

Given that the latest Dot was released in 2022 and the 4th Gen Echo came out two years before that, there are obvious technical upgrades in the Dot that don't exist in its bulkier predecessor.But more importantly, when is a good time to shop for these devices? Yes, they're affordable, the Echo starts at $99.99 and the Dot $49.99, however, you don't need to — and shouldn't — buy them at full price. The best time to buy is during shopping holidays like Black Friday, when you'll find Echos at their lowest prices ever. We've seen the Echo Dot go as low as $22.99.The Echo (Fourth Generation) and Echo Dot (Fifth Generation) fall in the middle of the Echo line-up.

Follow the on-screen instructions from that point on and personalize the device to your liking.\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            What you get when you order an Amazon Echo Dot.\n            Credit: Stacia Datskovska / Mashable\n        \n    \nSmarter, easier living featuresEchoThe Amazon Echo functions as your personal butler and best friend. Since it's a smart speaker that connects to the Alexa Voice Service, you use it to do everything from playing the latest hits to purchasing some kitchen staples to killing your boredom with a round of Jeopardy! Advanced sound technology helps the Echo immediately respond to you and recognize your voice. In fact, during the setup process on the Alexa app, Echo learns your voice's cadences and pitch by making you repeat some sample prompts. Impressive.\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            You can tell Alexa exactly what to put on your grocery list and manage the items on your Alexa app.\n            Credit: Screenshot: Amazon\n        \n    \nPrompt response: Beamforming technology, noise-cancellation, and seven microphones will enable the Echo to hear you from your nearby location. Just speak the wake word and say commands like “Alexa, find an Amazon Music playlist,” or “Alexa, call Dad” for immediate assistance. Something to note: Your speaker does not by any means have to be called Alexa. Other fun options include Echo, Ziggy, or Santa. Referring to your device as that last option unlocks a whole new Ho-Ho-Ho personality for it. Another thing to note: Amazon is getting better about accessibility, in the form of Adaptive Listening. This feature, when enabled, essentially gives you more time to finish speaking — Alexa's way of accommodating speech patterns like stuttering.Beats master: Of course the Echo can play music, but it’s more than a basic speaker. It comes with Dolby premium sound that fills a whole room — with deep bass and clear high notes alike. If you have two Echo devices in one room, you can actually tell one of them to \"play music everywhere,\" which will amplify sound to even higher levels and make for an actual at-home clubbing experience. Word of caution, however — Alexa didn't cooperate with me, strangely, when I tried to test out this feature. For those of us who are highly picky about music streaming services, Amazon lets you set default options which you can change at any time. Do you want Alexa to pick music from Apple Music but podcasts from Spotify? No problem, there's an option for that.Hands-free communication: If you need to message or call loved ones, the Echo has your back. You can use Alexa to communicate with people via phone or text on the Echo, without grabbing your smartphone. Plus, Alexa can also make household announcements across Amazon Echo devices at home, so your family knows if dinner is ready or guests are arriving. Use the Drop-In feature to connect to other Amazon Echo devices or the Announcement feature to record cute messages in your own voice (accompanied by a range of sound effect offerings, including dinner bell, kiss, trumpet, as well as, a bit alarmingly, toilet flush and fart).Control smart devices: If you have other smart devices that work with Alexa, you can easily control them with Echo's Zigbee smart home hub. Just ask Alexa to dim the lights, adjust the room temperature, or turn on a compatible smart-plug-connected appliance. The best thing about this? You don’t have to press any buttons, and you can even engineer routines for yourself ahead of time to set these processes in motion at a certain time in your home.\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            The Echo can double as a night light\n            Credit: Stacia Datskovska / Mashable \n        \n    \nEcho DotMaking the smart living switch isn’t always budget-friendly, but the Echo Dot is affordable and provides great voice control features. These features aren't all that different from what you get with the Echo. The only true upgrades are new motion sensors that let you touch-control the device, the 1.73-inch front-firing speaker (versus a woofer and tweeters), and \"Eero mesh network support so the Echo Dot can serve as a node for your Eero network if you use one,\" according to our sister site, PCMag. Use the Dot to receive reminders, save cookie recipes to your app for future reference, bask your room in a night light glow, communicate with friends and family, soothe yourself with some white noise, and beyond.Listening companion: We’ve all tried the conventional speaker setup, which typically involves too many outlets and wires. Echo Dot offers the opposite experience for all your listening needs. You can use your voice to play music through streaming services, including Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Spotify. Plus, Audible and other media forms are available on the Echo Dot. Ask Alexa to find the perfect playlist or podcast, and you’ll have something to listen to when you cook in the kitchen, lounge on the couch, or work out in your living room. Another extra-cool feature? The Dot will start playing deep sleep music when it detects sounds of snoring — if you enable it to do so.Task help: There are times we wish that we had a personal assistant for little things, including making lists and scheduling calendars. The Echo Dot helps make your everyday routine (and entertainment) more seamless with voice control. Try saying: \"Alexa, set a timer for five minutes,\" \"Alexa, play the Reuters news briefing,\" \"Alexa, open my daily horoscope,\" or \"Alexa, find my phone.\" The possibilities are endless. Be sure to reference the \"more\" tab on the Alexa app to browse through all of the Echo Dot's offerings.\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            Use the Dot to send messages to houseguests, remind you of tasks, and more!\n            Credit: Screenshot: Amazon\n        \n    \nConverse with and check in on loved ones: Like the Echo, the Echo Dot allows you to send messages, make phone calls, and use other Echo devices as intercoms. Enjoy hands-free communication with loved ones and make announcements via Drop-In to keep everyone in touch at home. If you have elderly parents at home, you can also take advantage of Alexa Together — Amazon's remote caregiving offering that does cost extra but allows you to connect compatible fall detection devices to the Echo Dot, see snapshots of your loved ones' daily interactions with Alexa, get 24/7 access to trained agents who can call 911 in case of an emergency, create gentle reminders such as \"take your pills,\" and more.Monitor your smart home environment: The Echo Dot also offers the option to monitor smart devices at home. If you have light bulbs, thermostats, or streaming media players that are compatible with Alexa, you can control their activity with the Echo Dot. Just speak to Alexa in your room of choice, and you can easily monitor lighting, temperature, and more with verbal commands. Also, if you enable sound detection routines, you can program a particular sound (dog barking, oven dinging, door opening) to trigger a certain Alexa Routine. This feature has an accessibility bonus since it can be used as a way to provide visual cues to those with hearing challenges. For instance, \"if Alexa detects running water for a period of time... she can trigger the living room smart lights to flash on and off, serving as a visual reminder to shut off the faucet,\" as reported in USA Today.\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            Don't let the Dot's size fool you — it's mighty smart.\n            Credit: Stacia Datskovska / Mashable \n        \n    \nPrice and competitionEchoAt $99.99, the Echo is moderately priced, but it comes with benefits that go beyond other smart speakers. With its high-tech sound features, including Dolby audio, you’ll be able to enjoy your favorite beats at the right volume. When you’re entertaining guests, you can engage the multi-room music feature to turn your pad into a dance floor (adjusting bass settings accordingly). In addition to playing music, the Echo allows you to control smart devices and communicate with loved ones via voice control. It also comes with a skills range so extensive that it might take you months to try them all out.The Echo comes with a one-year limited warranty that covers defects in materials and workmanship. If you would like additional protection, you can buy an extended warranty separately at Amazon.In terms of competition, the $99.99 Apple HomePod mini can be considered a pretty close match (at least price-wise). It's teeny compared to the Echo, though, and a larger/more advanced Apple smart speaker — the HomePod — will cost you $299 (see our full review of the Apple Homepod). While this competitor might be a better choice for Apple fans, due to its easy iOS compatibility, Siri isn't as smart or loyal of an assistant as Alexa in our opinion.Echo DotFor those on a technology budget, the 5th Gen Echo Dot delivers all the smart speaker benefits at a fraction of the price. At $49.99, it’s more affordable than other Amazon Echo devices (despite being the newest Dot) and still has desirable features like advanced voice recognition, smart device control, and assistance with small tasks via Alexa.Unlike the Echo, the Echo Dot only comes with a 90-day limited warranty. It’s applicable to defects in materials and workmanship and you can contact Amazon’s Customer Service for assistance. This warranty, too, can be extended to a one-year, two-year, or even three-year plan for an additional fee.If we're talking about what's available on the smart speaker market that can compare to the Dot, the Google-Assistant-powered Nest Mini (2nd Generation) immediately comes to mind, as it also costs $49.99. The Nest Mini is cute as a button (and weighs almost as much). It's compatible with streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, and iHeart Radio, as well as Youtube, has smart home pairing with Arlo, Nest, Ring, and other appliances, and it allows you to voice-purchase essentials from storefronts that aren't limited to Amazon. Still, with the Dot's new-and-improved front-firing speaker, there's no question that it wins the contest when it comes to quality audio. Also, with its upgraded temperature and movement sensors, the Dot seems to be leading the smart home game. I mean, what other speaker will listen for the sound of broken glass and immediately alert you to a potential robbery happening when you're MIA?\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            Clearly, the Echo is way bigger than the Echo Dot (reflected in their price difference).\n            Credit: Stacia Datskovska / Mashable\n        \n    \nPrivacy concernsWith all Amazon Echo devices comes concern about privacy. In the past, according to what reporter Jack Morse wrote for Mashable a few years back, \"Alexa has been known to record people and rooms even when there's no wake word spoken intentionally — or spoken at all.\" The fact that it can be listening in on your most private conversations — or else sneakily gather info like a credit card number you say when purchasing something over the phone — is legitimately scary.Amazon has realized that tons of people have been turning away from their Echo product line because of this very risk. That's why now, on the Alexa app, you can review your daily voice history and delete anything you don't vibe with, manage the access to data certain skills have, and more. On the exterior of both the 4th Gen Echo and 5th Gen Echo Dot, you can also find a mic-off button that will prevent any audio input from reaching Alexa. For more information about how Amazon handles user privacy, check out its Q&A on the matter.So, to Echo or to Echo Dot?If you want a large smart speaker that delivers high-quality sound, allows you to engage in hands-free control, and use your voice to communicate with loved ones, the $99.99 4th Gen Echo is a good call. Another perk of this device is that it’s customizable: You can choose a decorative shell to compliment your home decor vibe. Plus, it works with other Amazon Echo devices for the ultimate sound setup whenever you need it.If you don’t want to fork over a lot of cash for a smart speaker, the Echo Dot is a great pick — especially considering it's newer than the 4th Gen Echo. At only $49.99, it’s a steal compared to other Amazon-connected devices and offers the same smart speaker benefits... and then some."

While you can't replace the feel of paper, the beauty of bound hardcovers, and the ritual of turning the page, an e-reader brings convenience and portability that, yes, a book can't beat. Sure, you can throw a book in your tote bag, but what about an entire library?\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            We tried every Amazon Kindle to find the best for every bibliophile\n            \n        \n    \nWhen you think of e-readers, your first thought is likely an Amazon Kindle, and while it wasn't the first e-reader to hit the market, it is indeed the one to dominate the market.

For instance, most e-readers are easily compatible with Libby but maybe you also want to take advantage of programs like Kindle Unlimited.To decide what kind of e-reader is right for you, consider the overall design that best suits you.

This Amazon gaming bundle gives you the essentials to get started with Amazon's game streaming service, Luna, for just $79.98. That's 38% off its usual price. The bundle includes the Fire TV Stick 4K Max and a Luna controller, which our friends at <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-luna-controller\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">PCMag</a> (also owned by Ziff Davis) called \"an excellent gamepad that provides the optimal Luna game-streaming experience.\" The real standout is its separate WiFi connection, which helps reduce input lag as you play. While technically an optional add-on for the Luna gaming experience, they called it a \"must-have.\" The Fire TV Stick 4K Max allows you to access popular games &mdash; all you'll need to get started is the Luna app and a Prime or Luna subscription. </p><h2>Sonos Ace</h2><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div class=\"mx-auto w-64 md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                                                        <a class=\"block group\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/aR8JbV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=image&element_label=image&object_type=article&object_uuid=04EGmdLgZbmlvBrsFeKsvJV&short_url=aR8JbV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click>\n                                                                            <img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04EGmdLgZbmlvBrsFeKsvJV/images-7.fill.size_170x256.v1734014414.jpg\" alt=\"Sonos Ace headphones in black\" width=\"170\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\n                        \n                        <div class=\"block relative mx-14 group-hover:visible tooltip\">\n                    <span class=\"absolute invisible p-1 mt-2 text-xs text-center text-white group-hover:visible tooltiptext bg-gray-600/0 group-hover:bg-gray-600/100\">\n                        Opens in a new window\n                    </span>\n                        </div>\n                                            </a>\n                                <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                            <span class=\"pr-5 mt-1 text-xs text-gray-600 subtitle-2\">Credit: Sonos</span>\n                                    </div>\n                        </div>\n    <div class=\"pl-0 mt-3 w-full md:pr-10 md:pl-7 md:mt-0 md:w-2/3\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aR8JbV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=title&element_label=Sonos%20Ace&object_type=article&object_uuid=04EGmdLgZbmlvBrsFeKsvJV&short_url=aR8JbV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\" class=\"block mb-5 text-xl font-bold leading-8 text-center md:text-2xl md:text-left hover:underline text-secondary-300\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Sonos Ace\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    Sonos Ace\n                </a>\n                                        <div class=\"flex justify-between items-center py-0 md:space-x-2\">\n                <div class=\"md:w-2/3\" style=\"line-height: 0.75rem\">\n                                            <span class=\"text-sm font-bold\">$349.00</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"text-xs\"> at Amazon</span>\n                                                <br>\n                                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold line-through\">$449.00</span>\n                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold text-red-400\"> Save $100.00</span>\n                                                            </div>\n            </div>\n                                                    <a class=\"font-bold leading-6 text-center hover:underline\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/aR8JbV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=buy-button&element_label=Get%20Deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=04EGmdLgZbmlvBrsFeKsvJV&short_url=aR8JbV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"Get Deal\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    <button class=\"inline-block px-5 mt-3 w-full font-sans text-base font-bold tracking-wide md:w-auto md:text-lg btn btn-secondary\">Get Deal</button>\n                </a>\n                        </div>\n</div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/sonos-ace-headphones\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">first Sonos headphones</a> dropped earlier this year and they're a force to be reckoned with. It's unsurprising, given that the brand makes some of our favorite audio equipment. They're aesthetically a 10, boast exceptional sound quality and spatial audio, and have a stellar 30-hour battery life with ANC. While we wish the ear cup seal was tighter to improve noise cancellation, Mashable's Deputy Reviews Editor Miller Kern still said she would recommend the Sonos Ace to \"true audiophiles who value incredible sound quality above all else.\" The price is a bit steep at $449, but they're back down to their Black Friday price of $349 as of Dec. 12. That's 22% in savings.</p><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/review/sonos-ace-headphones-review\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><em>Check out Mashable's full review of the Sonos Ace</em></a>.</p><h2>Yeti Hopper M15 Soft Cooler</h2><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div class=\"mx-auto w-64 md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                                                        <a class=\"block group\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/a0X5pe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=image&element_label=image&object_type=article&object_uuid=04EGmdLgZbmlvBrsFeKsvJV&short_url=a0X5pe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"3\" data-ga-click>\n                                                                            <img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04EGmdLgZbmlvBrsFeKsvJV/images-8.fill.size_250x256.v1734014414.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Hopper M15 teal soft cooler\" width=\"250\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\n                        \n                        <div class=\"block relative mx-14 group-hover:visible tooltip\">\n                    <span class=\"absolute invisible p-1 mt-2 text-xs text-center text-white group-hover:visible tooltiptext bg-gray-600/0 group-hover:bg-gray-600/100\">\n                        Opens in a new window\n                    </span>\n                        </div>\n                                            </a>\n                                <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                            <span class=\"pr-5 mt-1 text-xs text-gray-600 subtitle-2\">Credit: Yeti</span>\n                                    </div>\n                        </div>\n    <div class=\"pl-0 mt-3 w-full md:pr-10 md:pl-7 md:mt-0 md:w-2/3\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/a0X5pe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=title&element_label=Yeti%20Hopper%20M15%20Soft%20Cooler&object_type=article&object_uuid=04EGmdLgZbmlvBrsFeKsvJV&short_url=a0X5pe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\" class=\"block mb-5 text-xl font-bold leading-8 text-center md:text-2xl md:text-left hover:underline text-secondary-300\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Yeti Hopper M15 Soft Cooler\" data-ga-position=\"3\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    Yeti Hopper M15 Soft Cooler\n                </a>\n                                        <div class=\"flex justify-between items-center py-0 md:space-x-2\">\n                <div class=\"md:w-2/3\" style=\"line-height: 0.75rem\">\n                                            <span class=\"text-sm font-bold\">$210.00</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"text-xs\"> at Amazon</span>\n                                                <br>\n                                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold line-through\">$300.00</span>\n                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold text-red-400\"> Save $90.00</span>\n                                                            </div>\n            </div>\n                                                    <a class=\"font-bold leading-6 text-center hover:underline\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/a0X5pe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=buy-button&element_label=Get%20Deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=04EGmdLgZbmlvBrsFeKsvJV&short_url=a0X5pe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"Get Deal\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"3\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    <button class=\"inline-block px-5 mt-3 w-full font-sans text-base font-bold tracking-wide md:w-auto md:text-lg btn btn-secondary\">Get Deal</button>\n                </a>\n                        </div>\n</div>\n<p>If you've ever tried to haul a full-size hard cooler across a parking lot for a tailgate or worse, a beach, then you know how much of a struggle it can be. That's where the Yeti Hopper M15 Soft Cooler takes the cake. Ideal for everything from overnight camping trips to beach picnics to tailgates, this soft cooler is easy to tote around, even when it's packed to the brim. Speaking of which, it can hold up to 32 cans or 15 pounds of ice in its leak-resistant, puncture-resistant, closed-cell rubber-insulated shell. It's usually $300, but you can save $90 and pick it up for only $210 as of Dec. 12. That's $15 cheaper than it was on Black Friday.</p><h2>Amazon Echo Hub</h2><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div class=\"mx-auto w-64 md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                                                        <a class=\"block group\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/aDVwRN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=image&element_label=image&object_type=article&object_uuid=04EGmdLgZbmlvBrsFeKsvJV&short_url=aDVwRN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"4\" data-ga-click>\n                                                                            <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04EGmdLgZbmlvBrsFeKsvJV/images-9.fill.size_256x176.v1734014414.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Echo Hub \" width=\"256\" height=\"176\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\n                        \n                        <div class=\"block relative mx-14 group-hover:visible tooltip\">\n                    <span class=\"absolute invisible p-1 mt-2 text-xs text-center text-white group-hover:visible tooltiptext bg-gray-600/0 group-hover:bg-gray-600/100\">\n                        Opens in a new window\n                    </span>\n                        </div>\n                                            </a>\n                                <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                            <span class=\"pr-5 mt-1 text-xs text-gray-600 subtitle-2\">Credit: Amazon</span>\n                                    </div>\n                        </div>\n    <div class=\"pl-0 mt-3 w-full md:pr-10 md:pl-7 md:mt-0 md:w-2/3\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aDVwRN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=title&element_label=Amazon%20Echo%20Hub&object_type=article&object_uuid=04EGmdLgZbmlvBrsFeKsvJV&short_url=aDVwRN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\" class=\"block mb-5 text-xl font-bold leading-8 text-center md:text-2xl md:text-left hover:underline text-secondary-300\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Amazon Echo Hub\" data-ga-position=\"4\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    Amazon Echo Hub\n                </a>\n                                        <div class=\"flex justify-between items-center py-0 md:space-x-2\">\n                <div class=\"md:w-2/3\" style=\"line-height: 0.75rem\">\n                                            <span class=\"text-sm font-bold\">$124.99</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"text-xs\"> at Amazon</span>\n                                                <br>\n                                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold line-through\">$179.99</span>\n                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold text-red-400\"> Save $55.00</span>\n                                                            </div>\n            </div>\n                                                    <a class=\"font-bold leading-6 text-center hover:underline\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/aDVwRN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=buy-button&element_label=Get%20Deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=04EGmdLgZbmlvBrsFeKsvJV&short_url=aDVwRN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"Get Deal\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"4\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    <button class=\"inline-block px-5 mt-3 w-full font-sans text-base font-bold tracking-wide md:w-auto md:text-lg btn btn-secondary\">Get Deal</button>\n                </a>\n                        </div>\n</div>\n<p>Instead of keeping smart device control locked inside of someone's phone in your household, Amazon created the Echo Hub.

This Amazon gaming bundle gives you the essentials to get started with Amazon's game streaming service, Luna, for just $79.98. That's 38% off its usual price. The bundle includes the Fire TV Stick 4K Max and a Luna controller, which our friends at PCMag (also owned by Ziff Davis) called \"an excellent gamepad that provides the optimal Luna game-streaming experience.\" The real standout is its separate WiFi connection, which helps reduce input lag as you play. While technically an optional add-on for the Luna gaming experience, they called it a \"must-have.\" The Fire TV Stick 4K Max allows you to access popular games — all you'll need to get started is the Luna app and a Prime or Luna subscription.

It's unsurprising, given that the brand makes some of our favorite audio equipment. They're aesthetically a 10, boast exceptional sound quality and spatial audio, and have a stellar 30-hour battery life with ANC. While we wish the ear cup seal was tighter to improve noise cancellation, Mashable's Deputy Reviews Editor Miller Kern still said she would recommend the Sonos Ace to \"true audiophiles who value incredible sound quality above all else.\" The price is a bit steep at $449, but they're back down to their Black Friday price of $349 as of Dec. 12. That's 22% in savings.Check out Mashable's full review of the Sonos Ace.Yeti Hopper M15 Soft Cooler\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Yeti\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Yeti Hopper M15 Soft Cooler\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $210.00\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $300.00\n                                                                             Save $90.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nIf you've ever tried to haul a full-size hard cooler across a parking lot for a tailgate or worse, a beach, then you know how much of a struggle it can be. That's where the Yeti Hopper M15 Soft Cooler takes the cake. Ideal for everything from overnight camping trips to beach picnics to tailgates, this soft cooler is easy to tote around, even when it's packed to the brim. Speaking of which, it can hold up to 32 cans or 15 pounds of ice in its leak-resistant, puncture-resistant, closed-cell rubber-insulated shell. It's usually $300, but you can save $90 and pick it up for only $210 as of Dec. 12. That's $15 cheaper than it was on Black Friday.Amazon Echo Hub\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Amazon\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Amazon Echo Hub\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $124.99\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $179.99\n                                                                             Save $55.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nInstead of keeping smart device control locked inside of someone's phone in your household, Amazon created the Echo Hub. Think of it as our smart home's brain. It offers a full-featured control panel with instant access to all of your gadgets — smart lighting, cameras, switches, doorbells, thermostat, etc. Everyone can play music, stream videos, ask Alexa questions, dim the lights, adjust the temperature, or see who's on the other side of the door in one central spot in your home. As of Dec. 12, it's on sale for $124.99 — that's 31% off its usual cost of $179.99.Bose SoundLink Revolve+\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Bose\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Bose SoundLink Revolve+ (Series II)\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $229.00\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $329.00\n                                                                             Save $100.00\n                                                            \n            \n                            + get $10 in Amazon credit\n                                            \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nBose is a powerhouse in the audio world and its SoundLink Revolve+ II is further proof. It's one of our favorite portable Bluetooth speakers because of its true 360-degree surround sound experience. The second-generation speaker bumps up the battery life from 12 to 17 hours, is a bit louder, has improved bass levels, and features a convenient handle on top for portability. It's usually $329, but as of Dec. 12, you can pick it up at Amazon for only $229 and get a $10 Amazon credit to spend on a future purchase.None of these deals catching your eye?

The iPad Pro got the M4 chip before any MacBook, making it not just the speediest tablet we've ever tested, but giving it more processing power than many laptops. Plus, the Mini, which still comes in a delightfully compact 8.3-inch size, got an upgrade to the A17 chip and is now compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro.</p><p>So with Apple's big year in tablets, it's no wonder they're the darling of the holiday season. If you're looking to gift a tablet to yourself or a loved one this season, iPads are a no-brainer. Not only do they have laptop-level speed and performance, but they're versatile. iPads let you work, design, stream, and read all from one compact device.</p><p>In the post-Cyber Week haze, Best Buy has kept the good deals rolling with a special Apple shopping event, offering exclusive savings on devices. Today is the last day, so if you've had something in your shopping cart, now is the time to hit buy.

The iPad Pro got the M4 chip before any MacBook, making it not just the speediest tablet we've ever tested, but giving it more processing power than many laptops. Plus, the Mini, which still comes in a delightfully compact 8.3-inch size, got an upgrade to the A17 chip and is now compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro.So with Apple's big year in tablets, it's no wonder they're the darling of the holiday season. If you're looking to gift a tablet to yourself or a loved one this season, iPads are a no-brainer. Not only do they have laptop-level speed and performance, but they're versatile. iPads let you work, design, stream, and read all from one compact device.In the post-Cyber Week haze, Best Buy has kept the good deals rolling with a special Apple shopping event, offering exclusive savings on devices. Today is the last day, so if you've had something in your shopping cart, now is the time to hit buy.

The Apple iPad (10th gen) is the best iPad for most people. The 10.9-inch screen is just the right size whether you're working or streaming shows on-the-go. For illustrators and hobbyists alike, this iPad is compatible with the USB-C and first generation of Apple Pencil. The A14 chip, while a few generations behind, still provides performance prowess that won't disappoint.During Best Buy's Apple event, you can find the most savings on this device. It's down 20%, bringing it to $279 for $70 off. So if you're looking to get an iPad on a budget, you can score one for under $300 with this deal.More iPad dealsApple iPad Mini (A17 chip, 128GB, WiFi) — $449 $499 (save $50)Apple iPad Air, 11-inch (M2 chip, 128GB, WiFi) — $499 $599 (save $100)Apple iPad Pro, 11-inch (M4 chip, 256GB, WiFi) — $899 $999 (save $100)Apple iPad Pro, 13-inch (M4 chip, 256GB, WiFi) — $1,099 $1,299 (save $200)Apple iPad, 13-inch (M4 chip, 512GB, WiFi) — $1,299 $1,499 (save $200)"

No one likes mopping, either. That's why robot vacuums are such a boon if you run a busy household and just don't have the time to keep running a traditional unit &mdash; and it's even better when it can mop, too. Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but you can still save big on an appliance that can take care of both needs for a major steal. </p><p>As of Dec. 12, get the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/ao5wvg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Yeedi%20M12%20Pro%2B%20robot%20vacuum%20and%20mop&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j0tH0QtfAEOBzy1canpAl&short_url=ao5wvg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Yeedi M12 Pro+ robot vacuum and mop</a> for just $549.99 at Amazon.

It comes with its own compact station for auto-empty,  as well as a one tap self-cleaning option and an auto-refill with drain button for when you take advantage of the mop.</p><p>When it's finished sucking up all the dirt and debris in your floor, it can switch from carpet to floors that need to be mopped.

No one likes mopping, either. That's why robot vacuums are such a boon if you run a busy household and just don't have the time to keep running a traditional unit — and it's even better when it can mop, too. Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but you can still save big on an appliance that can take care of both needs for a major steal. As of Dec. 12, get the Yeedi M12 Pro+ robot vacuum and mop for just $549.99 at Amazon. That's $449.01 off its usual price of $999, and a discount of 45%. It's also the lowest price we've seen for this unit. \n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            The best robot vacuums in 2024\n            \n        \n    \nThis compact robovac and mop offers powerful suction with both flat and outward-rotating bristles that keeps it from getting tangled up in hair and losing its cleaning efficiency. It comes with its own compact station for auto-empty,  as well as a one tap self-cleaning option and an auto-refill with drain button for when you take advantage of the mop.When it's finished sucking up all the dirt and debris in your floor, it can switch from carpet to floors that need to be mopped. It uses its special auto-lift mopping system to keep the mopping plates up out of the way when it detects carpet. And when it's time to use them, it offers great stain removal and powerful scrubbing with a 55mL water tank that can handle stains that have set in. Whether you hate cleaning or you would prefer to take the day off and let a robot do all the hard stuff, this is a deal worth buying into before it's gone."

All you have to do is add contacts you&rsquo;d like to call in the Alexa app on your phone. However, it may not be a necessary purchase if you already have a tablet with great video functionality. And if you want a larger device as your smart home hub, the <a href=\"https://mashable.com/review/echo-show-10-amazon\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Echo Show 10</a> is an even better choice.</p><p>Regardless, the Echo Show 8 offers some other advantages for video calls in addition to its size.</p><p>On the other hand, the Echo Show 5 would be better in places where you want the device's functionality, without it being front and center &mdash; like your desk or nightstand.</p><p>And if you're a sucker for colorways, the Echo Show 8 only comes in the glacier white and charcoal color options. You can get more variety with the new Echo Show 5, which comes in glacier white, charcoal, and deep sea blue. The Echo Show 5 Kids comes in chameleon green.</p><h2>Camera and video calling</h2><p>The Echo Show 5 got a decent camera upgrade from its 1st gen version &mdash; increasing the megapixels from one to two. However, it was a whole different ball game for the Echo Show 8. While the 1st gen Echo Show 8 offered a 1 MP camera, the revamped 2021 model came equipped with a 13 MP camera, which carried over into the 2023 model. </p><div class=\"flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/review/amazon-echo-show-15\" class=\"flex items-center text-secondary-300\">\n            <span class=\"ml-1\">Amazon's Echo Show 15 is a smart hub for connected homes</span>\n            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current\"><use href=\"https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n<p>The image is <em>incredibly </em>crisp, and alongside the larger screen makes the Echo Show 8 the video call winner. But that&rsquo;s not even the best part: The Echo Show 8 features auto-framing functions that automatically pan and zoom the camera to keep it focused on the people in view.</p><p>Both devices also feature some handy connectivity features, like intercom to page every Alexa device in the house (&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving in 15 minutes, so be ready!&rdquo;) and drop-in, which allows you to video chat with any connected Alexa device.</p><h3>Zoom calls</h3><p>The Echo Show 8 can also join Zoom calls, while the Echo Show 5 can&rsquo;t. To be totally honest, I could not get the Zoom call feature to work after several tries because none of the calls I joined had a dial-in number. </p><p>I&rsquo;ll still say the Echo Show 8 wins on this one just because it&rsquo;s theoretically possible, and I&rsquo;m really hoping to be able to join Zoom calls from it soon to free up my laptop and extra monitor for in-meeting multi-tasking.</p><h2>Kid-friendly content</h2><p>During the initial setup, you can choose to make any Echo Show device a dedicated device for a kid. This gives you access to some expanded parental controls, which is great for older children, tweens, and teens that you still want to shield from some of the worst things the internet has to offer.</p><p>However, the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/91bGZw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Show%205%20Kids&object_type=article&object_uuid=073bv393q3gg6vR5o1TbOpo&short_url=91bGZw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Echo Show 5 Kids</a> is the first and only Echo Show that&rsquo;s bottom-to-top and side-to-side designed for kids. It features a fun design (the chameleon color looks like dinosaur scales, according to my 5-year-old), and comes with a free year of Amazon Kids (usually $5.99 per month) &mdash; which offers curated books, games, and videos just for kids far beyond what&rsquo;s available through a basic Prime membership. In addition, it comes with souped-up parental controls so you can tweak things even more.</p><h2>Alexa functionality</h2><p>Both the 2nd gen Echo Show 5 and the 2nd gen Echo Show 8 have some Alexa abilities that their 1st gen counterparts don&rsquo;t.</p><p>First up is the home monitoring function, where you can remotely access the camera on your device from the Alexa app just to check in on things. You&rsquo;ll need a WiFi connection to do it, but I had no problems getting it to work. I can imagine it would be great to check in on pets, the babysitter, or just to take a peek at your home while on vacation to make sure everything is on the up and up.</p><p>Next is the addition of motion-enabled routines. This allows Alexa to detect when you enter or leave a room and use that activity to start a routine. Fair warning, this can open a can of worms re: privacy, but it also opens up some exciting possibilities for the smart home buff. You could have Alexa read your calendar when you walk into your office, or turn off all smart-enabled devices when there&rsquo;s no motion detected in the living room &mdash; and those are just two simple ideas. With the addition of Alexa-enabled devices or smart plugs, your options open up even more.

    "sanitized": "Editor's note: This comparison originally focused on the 2021 models of the Echo Show 5 and Echo Show 8. New models (with only modest changes) were released in 2023, so the older versions are no longer available to purchase as new. We've updated our links to take you to the current Echo Show 5 and Echo Show 8. Our original comparison follows.It can be exciting when a brand like Amazon drops new versions of its devices, but it can also be overwhelming to figure out which one is best for you (and if it's worth paying more than its original version). After testing the second generations of both the Echo Show 5 and the Echo Show 8, I'll walk you through what’s the same, what’s different, what they bring to the table compared to the first gen versions.While these smart displays don’t have the portability or functionality of an iPad or a Surface tablet, they work flawlessly with Alexa and serve as a smart home HQ to make your day-to-day life just a little bit more streamlined.\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Rate your favorite smart home gear for a chance to win a $250 Amazon gift card\n            \n        \n    \nSize: It's in the nameThe most noticeable difference between the Echo Show 5 and the Echo Show 8 is, of course, their size. The Echo Show 5 has a 5.5-inch screen and 6-inch x 3-inch footprint, while the Echo Show 8 is significantly larger — boasting an 8-inch screen and an 8-inch x 4-inch footprint.\n        \n        \n                                        \n                \n                                            Echo Show 5 (2nd gen) is smaller and would work better in a bedroom or office.\n                                                                Credit: Amazon\n                                    \n                    \n        \n                                        \n                \n                                            Echo Show 8 (2nd gen) is significantly larger — best for a central house hub.\n                                                                Credit: amazon\n                                    \n                    \n    \n\nIn my opinion, that makes the Echo Show 8 way better suited to be your family “hub” — located in a central location like the kitchen or dining room for easy video calls with the grandparents using Alexa. All you have to do is add contacts you’d like to call in the Alexa app on your phone. However, it may not be a necessary purchase if you already have a tablet with great video functionality. And if you want a larger device as your smart home hub, the Echo Show 10 is an even better choice.Regardless, the Echo Show 8 offers some other advantages for video calls in addition to its size.On the other hand, the Echo Show 5 would be better in places where you want the device's functionality, without it being front and center — like your desk or nightstand.And if you're a sucker for colorways, the Echo Show 8 only comes in the glacier white and charcoal color options. You can get more variety with the new Echo Show 5, which comes in glacier white, charcoal, and deep sea blue. The Echo Show 5 Kids comes in chameleon green.Camera and video callingThe Echo Show 5 got a decent camera upgrade from its 1st gen version — increasing the megapixels from one to two. However, it was a whole different ball game for the Echo Show 8. While the 1st gen Echo Show 8 offered a 1 MP camera, the revamped 2021 model came equipped with a 13 MP camera, which carried over into the 2023 model. \n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Amazon's Echo Show 15 is a smart hub for connected homes\n            \n        \n    \nThe image is incredibly crisp, and alongside the larger screen makes the Echo Show 8 the video call winner. But that’s not even the best part: The Echo Show 8 features auto-framing functions that automatically pan and zoom the camera to keep it focused on the people in view.Both devices also feature some handy connectivity features, like intercom to page every Alexa device in the house (“We’re leaving in 15 minutes, so be ready!”) and drop-in, which allows you to video chat with any connected Alexa device.Zoom callsThe Echo Show 8 can also join Zoom calls, while the Echo Show 5 can’t. To be totally honest, I could not get the Zoom call feature to work after several tries because none of the calls I joined had a dial-in number. I’ll still say the Echo Show 8 wins on this one just because it’s theoretically possible, and I’m really hoping to be able to join Zoom calls from it soon to free up my laptop and extra monitor for in-meeting multi-tasking.Kid-friendly contentDuring the initial setup, you can choose to make any Echo Show device a dedicated device for a kid. This gives you access to some expanded parental controls, which is great for older children, tweens, and teens that you still want to shield from some of the worst things the internet has to offer.However, the Echo Show 5 Kids is the first and only Echo Show that’s bottom-to-top and side-to-side designed for kids. It features a fun design (the chameleon color looks like dinosaur scales, according to my 5-year-old), and comes with a free year of Amazon Kids (usually $5.99 per month) — which offers curated books, games, and videos just for kids far beyond what’s available through a basic Prime membership. In addition, it comes with souped-up parental controls so you can tweak things even more.Alexa functionalityBoth the 2nd gen Echo Show 5 and the 2nd gen Echo Show 8 have some Alexa abilities that their 1st gen counterparts don’t.First up is the home monitoring function, where you can remotely access the camera on your device from the Alexa app just to check in on things. You’ll need a WiFi connection to do it, but I had no problems getting it to work. I can imagine it would be great to check in on pets, the babysitter, or just to take a peek at your home while on vacation to make sure everything is on the up and up.Next is the addition of motion-enabled routines. This allows Alexa to detect when you enter or leave a room and use that activity to start a routine. Fair warning, this can open a can of worms re: privacy, but it also opens up some exciting possibilities for the smart home buff. You could have Alexa read your calendar when you walk into your office, or turn off all smart-enabled devices when there’s no motion detected in the living room — and those are just two simple ideas. With the addition of Alexa-enabled devices or smart plugs, your options open up even more. Amazon does offer ways to manage these settings if you'd like to delete recordings or manage your data.All of these devices feature the same Alexa functionality you came to expect from the previous iteration of Echo Show devices.\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Echo Dot vs. Echo Pop: Which Amazon device should you buy?\n            \n        \n    \nEcho Show 5 vs. Echo Show 8: Which one is better?For only $45 more, the Echo Show 8 was the clear winner for me.

From experience, I know kids master how to swipe and scroll on touchscreens at just months old. This is why YouTube launched a YouTube Kids app for iPhone and Android devices back in 2015.</p><p>Now, for the first time since that launch, YouTube Kids has received a complete redesign. With that update, YouTube Kids looks a lot more like YouTube.</p><p>\"As part of YouTube's design modernization efforts, we&rsquo;re happy to announce that we&rsquo;re bringing a new look and feel to the YouTube Kids mobile app!\" reads a new update posted by YouTube earlier this week on the official YouTube Kids community site.</p><h2>Here's what's new in the YouTube Kids app</h2><p>The biggest update to the YouTube Kids app is obvious: The redesign.</p><p>Previously, YouTube Kids (as seen above) looked like an app for children. It barely resembled the current YouTube design at all.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/images-1.fill.size_2000x1442.v1733950183.png\" alt=\"Old YouTube Kids design\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1442\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/images-1.fill.size_800x577.v1733950183.png 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/images-1.fill.size_1400x1009.v1733950183.png 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/images-1.fill.size_2000x1442.v1733950183.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n\n\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2 subtitle-2 font-sans \">\n            <span class=\"normal-case text-gray-1000\">The old YouTube Kids app design</span>\n            <span class=\"text-gray-600 credit\">Credit: YouTube</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The new YouTube Kids (as seen below) looks like YouTube, but with a kids-oriented twist. The design is more colorful and visual, but it still distinctly like YouTube. The previous design was geared toward toddler-aged children, whereas this one looks like it's meant to be enjoyed throughout childhood.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/images-2.fill.size_2000x995.v1733950183.png\" alt=\"New YouTube Kids app design\" width=\"2000\" height=\"995\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/images-2.fill.size_800x398.v1733950183.png 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/images-2.fill.size_1400x696.v1733950183.png 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/images-2.fill.size_2000x995.v1733950183.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n\n\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2 subtitle-2 font-sans \">\n            <span class=\"normal-case text-gray-1000\">The new YouTube Kids app design</span>\n            <span class=\"text-gray-600 credit\">Credit: YouTube</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The redesign also brings a more YouTube-like user interface to YouTube Kids as well. YouTube Kids now displays video categories at the top of the homescreen just like YouTube does. The new navigation bar at the bottom of the page is basically straight from the main YouTube app as well.</p><p>Another big change is that YouTube Kids can now be used both horizontally and vertically just like the main YouTube app. Previously, YouTube Kids had to be used in landscape mode. But, now that shortform video is popular on the platform thanks to YouTube Shorts, that no longer makes sense.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/images-3.fill.size_349x750.v1733950183.png\" alt=\"New YouTube Kids app vertical design\" width=\"349\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/images-3.fill.size_800x1720.v1733950183.png 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/images-3.fill.size_1400x3010.v1733950183.png 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/images-3.fill.size_2000x4300.v1733950183.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n\n\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2 subtitle-2 font-sans max-w-3xl text-center mx-auto\">\n            <span class=\"normal-case text-gray-1000\">The new update to the YouTube Kids app allows users to view content vertically for the first time.</span>\n            <span class=\"text-gray-600 credit\">Credit: YouTube</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Aside from the redesign, everything else in YouTube Kids is basically the same. The app remains the best way for kids to safely watch age-appropriate YouTube content.

    "sanitized": "Your small children being on YouTube is inevitable at this point. From experience, I know kids master how to swipe and scroll on touchscreens at just months old. This is why YouTube launched a YouTube Kids app for iPhone and Android devices back in 2015.Now, for the first time since that launch, YouTube Kids has received a complete redesign. With that update, YouTube Kids looks a lot more like YouTube.\"As part of YouTube's design modernization efforts, we’re happy to announce that we’re bringing a new look and feel to the YouTube Kids mobile app!\" reads a new update posted by YouTube earlier this week on the official YouTube Kids community site.Here's what's new in the YouTube Kids appThe biggest update to the YouTube Kids app is obvious: The redesign.Previously, YouTube Kids (as seen above) looked like an app for children. It barely resembled the current YouTube design at all. \n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            The old YouTube Kids app design\n            Credit: YouTube\n        \n    \nThe new YouTube Kids (as seen below) looks like YouTube, but with a kids-oriented twist. The design is more colorful and visual, but it still distinctly like YouTube. The previous design was geared toward toddler-aged children, whereas this one looks like it's meant to be enjoyed throughout childhood.\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            The new YouTube Kids app design\n            Credit: YouTube\n        \n    \nThe redesign also brings a more YouTube-like user interface to YouTube Kids as well. YouTube Kids now displays video categories at the top of the homescreen just like YouTube does. The new navigation bar at the bottom of the page is basically straight from the main YouTube app as well.Another big change is that YouTube Kids can now be used both horizontally and vertically just like the main YouTube app. Previously, YouTube Kids had to be used in landscape mode. But, now that shortform video is popular on the platform thanks to YouTube Shorts, that no longer makes sense.\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            The new update to the YouTube Kids app allows users to view content vertically for the first time.\n            Credit: YouTube\n        \n    \nAside from the redesign, everything else in YouTube Kids is basically the same. The app remains the best way for kids to safely watch age-appropriate YouTube content. YouTube has greatly improved the content moderation issues that plagued the app years ago.A few comments on YouTube's update announcement have generated a negative response to the redesign. However, like it or not, the redesigned app should be preferable to what YouTube did to its smart TV kids app. Earlier this year, YouTube completely shut down its standalone kids app for TVs and integrated it into the main YouTube app for smart TVs."

I was pleased to discover the Google Pixel Watch 2 utilizes a Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 chip, as well as 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but the Apple Watch Series 9&rsquo;s specs are equally impressive with Apple&rsquo;s S9 chip, 1GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. Performance-wise, it would be pretty hard to distinguish between the two without rigorous side-by-side testing.</p><p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p><h2>Health and fitness tracking</h2><p>Both Apple Watch and Fitbit offer access to user-friendly health and fitness tracking, which means both brands allow you to track various metrics like steps, heart rate, workout duration, calories burned, sleep, and more. However, the best fitness tracker ultimately depends on what data you&rsquo;re interested in tracking, as this varies from brand to brand <em>and</em> from product to product.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06uHh7kWFtP5i0jqEzuSvV4/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720819777.jpg\" alt=\"woman's wrist wearing google pixel watch 2, fitbit charge 4, and apple watch series 4\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06uHh7kWFtP5i0jqEzuSvV4/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1720819777.jpg 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06uHh7kWFtP5i0jqEzuSvV4/images-2.fill.size_1400x787.v1720819777.jpg 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06uHh7kWFtP5i0jqEzuSvV4/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720819777.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n\n\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2 subtitle-2 font-sans \">\n            <span class=\"normal-case text-gray-1000\">Fitbit offers a wider range of activity trackers.</span>\n            <span class=\"text-gray-600 credit\">Credit: RJ Andersen / Mashable</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>For example, both Fitbit and Apple Watch offer sleep tracking, so you can track things like sleep duration and sleep stages, but both the Series 9 and the Google Pixel Watch 2 have relatively shorter battery lives (18 hours versus 24 hours, respectively). This makes them less-than-ideal for 24/7 wear, especially since they&rsquo;re a bit bigger than other sleep trackers like the <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/oura-ring-4-hands-on\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><u>Oura Ring</u></a>. However, Fitbit&rsquo;s other activity trackers &mdash; including the Luxe, Charge 6, and Inspire 3 &mdash; all boast five days of battery life (or more), making them better options for those interested in sleep data.</p><p>If you want to track GPS on your runs, both Apple Watch and Fitbit offer built-in GPS on most of their products (aside from the Fitbit Luxe and <a href=\"https://mashable.com/review/fitbit-inspire-3\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Inspire 3</a>). Heart Rate Zone training is also possible with both the Pixel Watch 2 and the Series 9, so you can get notifications mid-workout while changing zones, which isn&rsquo;t available on other Fitbit products.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though Fitbit does some pretty cool health tracking insights &mdash; including skin temperature, heart rate variability, and oxygen saturation &mdash; none of these are measured using the Google Pixel Watch 2 unless you wear it overnight. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch supports all of these measurements (aside from the <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-blood-oxygen\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><u>since-removed blood oxygen feature</u></a>) without needing to wear the watch overnight.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p><h2>Smartwatch functionality</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the best smartwatch between Apple Watch and Fitbit, the answer is pretty clear: choose whatever is compatible with your phone. Apple does seem to have the better smartwatch overall, but that doesn&rsquo;t really matter much if you aren&rsquo;t an iPhone user.</p><div class=\"flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/comparison/echo-dot-vs-echo-pop\" class=\"flex items-center text-secondary-300\">\n            <span class=\"ml-1\">Echo Dot vs. Echo Pop: Which Amazon device should you buy?</span>\n            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current\"><use href=\"https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re an <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/android\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Android</a> user, the Pixel Watch 2 does stand out over other Fitbit smartwatches. It&rsquo;s sleek, easy to use, and packed full of useful apps and features &mdash; including Google Assistant, Safety Check, and the Google Play Store &mdash; making it a more robust smartwatch than other models from Fitbit. Is it the best Android smartwatch on the market? It&rsquo;s hard to say, especially since the <a href=\"https://mashable.com/review/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><u>Samsung Galaxy 6 </u></a>has a pretty solid reputation, but it&rsquo;s worth watching to see what Google does with Fitbit next.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re an <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/iphone\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">iPhone</a> user, however, stick with an Apple Watch over a Fitbit smartwatch.

The Apple Watch Series 9 does offer an 18-hour battery life (36 hours in low power mode), but the Google Pixel Watch 2 slightly outperforms it with an advertised 24-hour battery life. Other Fitbit products are even more impressive, with a six+ day battery life for Fitbit&rsquo;s other smartwatches Versa 4 and Sense 2, as well as a five-day battery life for the Fitbit Luxe, seven-day for the Charge 6, and a whopping 10-day charge for the Inspire 3.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Winner: Fitbit</strong></p><h2>Durability and longevity</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a fitness tracker that can handle all kinds of wear and tear, both Apple Watch and Fitbit are pretty reliable options. All of Fitbit&rsquo;s products are water resistant up to 50 meters, and the Pixel Watch 2 holds a water-protection rating of 5 ATM (up to 50 meters), as well as an additional IP68 dust and water-protection rating. Apple Watches are also water resistant up to 50 meters &mdash; with the Series 9 holding an additional IP6X10 dust resistance rating (the SE does not) &mdash; while the Ultra 2 takes the cake with water resistance up to 100 meters, IP6X dust resistance, and an additional EN13319 rating for recreational scuba diving up to 40 meters.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as longevity, it&rsquo;s hard to make a straight comparison between the brands due to the variety of options available. Some <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/xih84q/fitbit_lifespan_info/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><u>Reddit users</u></a> say that their Fitbit trackers tend to last around two years, while other Redditors <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/15mzybc/what_is_the_general_lifespan_of_an_apple_watch/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><u>report</u></a> that their Apple Watch typically lasts four to six years. This is pretty on par with my experience, as I&rsquo;ve been using a Series 4 Apple Watch since January 2019 with no issues. Will the Google Pixel Watch 2 hold up quite as long? It&rsquo;s a little too soon to tell.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Winner: Apple Watch</strong></p><h2>Smartphone compatibility</h2><p>You might be wondering, &ldquo;Is Fitbit compatible with iPhone?&rdquo; Honestly, it depends.</p><p>The Fitbit app is compatible with most popular smartphones &mdash; including iOS and Android devices &mdash; and all of Fitbit&rsquo;s products are technically compatible with iPhone, aside from the Google Pixel Watch and the Pixel Watch 2. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that Fitbit&rsquo;s other smartwatches (the Versa 4 and the Sense 2) are <em>technically</em> compatible with iPhones, but that doesn&rsquo;t include many of the additional features like smartphone notifications.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, the best option for you depends on your phone. If you use an iPhone, stick with an Apple Watch or one of Fitbit&rsquo;s activity trackers. If you use an Android device, you can use any of Fitbit&rsquo;s products, which technically makes Fitbit the winner of this category.</p><p><strong>Winner: Fitbit</strong></p><h2>Price range</h2><p>Fitbit&rsquo;s wider product range means it has a better price range, too. If you&rsquo;re operating on a budget, that means Fitbit is the way to go. Its activity trackers are quite a bit cheaper than its smartwatches, with the Inspire 3 starting at $99, and its most popular tracker, the Charge 6, clocks in at $159.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a smartwatch, however, the prices are a little more comparable between brands. The Google Pixel Watch 2 starts at $349, making it slightly cheaper than the Apple Watch Series 9 (starts at $399) and slightly more expensive than the Apple Watch SE (starts at $249).&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, technically, there are more smartwatch options available from Fitbit &mdash; the Versa 4 ($199) and the Sense 2 ($249) &mdash; but considering they lack app stores, it doesn&rsquo;t really feel right to put them on the same tier as the Pixel Watch 2 or the Series 9. Fitbit also offers a kid-friendly smartwatch, the Ace LTE ($299), but it requires an additional $9.99 per month data plan.</p><p><strong>Winner: Fitbit</strong></p><h2>Other features</h2><p>While I enjoyed using Fitbit&rsquo;s products, there weren&rsquo;t many standout features that made me love one more than the other. The Pixel Watch 2 is a solid smartwatch, but so is the Series 9, so &mdash; again &mdash; it really depends on what phone you&rsquo;re using.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as activity trackers go, Fitbit had one semi-critical feature missing, at least for fellow gym rats: most of its lineup isn&rsquo;t compatible with exercise equipment, aside from the Charge 6. This means you can&rsquo;t connect any of your Fitbit devices &mdash; including the Google Pixel Watch 2 &mdash; to gym equipment (treadmills, stationary bikes, etc.) to view/sync data like heart rate, calories burned, and distance. Meanwhile, this is a baseline feature in Apple Watches &mdash; even my old Series 4 connects to compatible equipment at the gym using NFC functionality &mdash; which made it all the more surprising to discover that Fitbit skipped that feature.</p><p>Is it a dealbreaker? Probably not for most people, but it&rsquo;s a feature I&rsquo;ve really loved using on my Apple Watch, so not having it felt weird.</p><p><strong>Winner: Apple Watch</strong></p><h2>Apple Watch vs. Fitbit: The verdict</h2><p>It&rsquo;s not exactly the flashiest answer, but the clear winner between Apple Watch and Fitbit depends on you. If you&rsquo;re looking for a simple fitness tracker, the best Fitbit watch is likely the Charge 6. It packs a powerful punch into a tiny device &mdash; including health and fitness tracking, sleep tracking, built-in GPS, and more &mdash; while boasting a great battery life and a solid price tag.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re more interested in a quality smartwatch, then get whatever works with your phone. The Apple Watch is a fantastic choice that&rsquo;s both functional and durable, but the Google Pixel Watch 2 is shaping up to be a decent competitor.</p><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16

    "sanitized": "Smartwatches and activity trackers are a dime a dozen these days, but there are a few brands that stand out. Apple Watch has cultivated a stellar reputation in the smartwatch category — and the new Series 10 comes with some cool new upgrades — while brands like Fitbit have dominated the fitness tracking space. Since Google acquired Fitbit back in 2019, competition between the two brands has been fierce, especially now that the Google Pixel Watches utilize Fitbit’s health and wellness tracking.While there are certainly some stark differences between Apple Watches and Fitbits — and comparing certain models might seem like comparing apples and oranges — Google’s push into the smartwatch category, as well as Apple’s increasing dedication to health tracking features, means there’s more crossover between these brands than ever before.So, is it better to get an Apple Watch or a Fitbit? I put them both to the test — here’s everything you need to know.\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            Left: Google Pixel Watch 2 (with Fitbit integration) Right: Apple Watch Series 4\n            Credit: RJ Andersen / Mashable\n        \n    \nSizes and screensWhen it comes to display quality and screen size, there’s quite a bit of variety to choose from, especially when it comes to Fitbit. Because the brand offers both activity trackers and smartwatches, their trackers tend to be a bit smaller, simpler, and more discreet — the 1.45-inch Charge 6 touts a full-color AMOLED display with a maximum brightness of 450 nits — while their smartwatches offer larger, higher-quality displays. The Google Pixel Watch 2, for example, boasts a 41mm AMOLED display with a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, making it a much better option for those interested in a brighter, clearer display.\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Google Pixel Watch 2: How are they different?\n            \n        \n    \nWhile Apple doesn’t offer traditional fitness trackers, it does offer a solid range of smartwatch sizes — which is definitely a win compared to Fitbit’s single-size smartwatch offerings. The Series 9 is available in 41mm or 45mm (with the SE available in 40mm or 44mm, as well as the Ultra 2 in 49mm), and it has an unmatched Retina LTPO OLED display with a maximum brightness of 2,000 nits. Winner: AppleInternal hardwareWhile Fitbit boasts a broader product range, which means a wider variety of internal hardware, I decided to pit smartwatch against smartwatch to see which has the most impressive specs in this category. I was pleased to discover the Google Pixel Watch 2 utilizes a Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 chip, as well as 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but the Apple Watch Series 9’s specs are equally impressive with Apple’s S9 chip, 1GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. Performance-wise, it would be pretty hard to distinguish between the two without rigorous side-by-side testing.Winner: TieHealth and fitness trackingBoth Apple Watch and Fitbit offer access to user-friendly health and fitness tracking, which means both brands allow you to track various metrics like steps, heart rate, workout duration, calories burned, sleep, and more. However, the best fitness tracker ultimately depends on what data you’re interested in tracking, as this varies from brand to brand and from product to product.\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            Fitbit offers a wider range of activity trackers.\n            Credit: RJ Andersen / Mashable\n        \n    \nFor example, both Fitbit and Apple Watch offer sleep tracking, so you can track things like sleep duration and sleep stages, but both the Series 9 and the Google Pixel Watch 2 have relatively shorter battery lives (18 hours versus 24 hours, respectively). This makes them less-than-ideal for 24/7 wear, especially since they’re a bit bigger than other sleep trackers like the Oura Ring. However, Fitbit’s other activity trackers — including the Luxe, Charge 6, and Inspire 3 — all boast five days of battery life (or more), making them better options for those interested in sleep data.If you want to track GPS on your runs, both Apple Watch and Fitbit offer built-in GPS on most of their products (aside from the Fitbit Luxe and Inspire 3). Heart Rate Zone training is also possible with both the Pixel Watch 2 and the Series 9, so you can get notifications mid-workout while changing zones, which isn’t available on other Fitbit products. Even though Fitbit does some pretty cool health tracking insights — including skin temperature, heart rate variability, and oxygen saturation — none of these are measured using the Google Pixel Watch 2 unless you wear it overnight. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch supports all of these measurements (aside from the since-removed blood oxygen feature) without needing to wear the watch overnight. Winner: TieSmartwatch functionalityIf you’re looking for the best smartwatch between Apple Watch and Fitbit, the answer is pretty clear: choose whatever is compatible with your phone. Apple does seem to have the better smartwatch overall, but that doesn’t really matter much if you aren’t an iPhone user.\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Echo Dot vs. Echo Pop: Which Amazon device should you buy?\n            \n        \n    \nIf you’re an Android user, the Pixel Watch 2 does stand out over other Fitbit smartwatches. It’s sleek, easy to use, and packed full of useful apps and features — including Google Assistant, Safety Check, and the Google Play Store — making it a more robust smartwatch than other models from Fitbit. Is it the best Android smartwatch on the market? It’s hard to say, especially since the Samsung Galaxy 6 has a pretty solid reputation, but it’s worth watching to see what Google does with Fitbit next. If you’re an iPhone user, however, stick with an Apple Watch over a Fitbit smartwatch. Technically, Fitbit’s other smartwatches — the Versa 4 and Sense 2 — are compatible with both Android and iOS, but some of the features (like smartphone notifications) only work with Android phones…and it’s hard to beat Apple’s smartwatch experience.Winner: Apple WatchBattery lifeAs far as battery life, Fitbit takes the crown. The Apple Watch Series 9 does offer an 18-hour battery life (36 hours in low power mode), but the Google Pixel Watch 2 slightly outperforms it with an advertised 24-hour battery life. Other Fitbit products are even more impressive, with a six+ day battery life for Fitbit’s other smartwatches Versa 4 and Sense 2, as well as a five-day battery life for the Fitbit Luxe, seven-day for the Charge 6, and a whopping 10-day charge for the Inspire 3. Winner: FitbitDurability and longevityIf you’re looking for a fitness tracker that can handle all kinds of wear and tear, both Apple Watch and Fitbit are pretty reliable options. All of Fitbit’s products are water resistant up to 50 meters, and the Pixel Watch 2 holds a water-protection rating of 5 ATM (up to 50 meters), as well as an additional IP68 dust and water-protection rating. Apple Watches are also water resistant up to 50 meters — with the Series 9 holding an additional IP6X10 dust resistance rating (the SE does not) — while the Ultra 2 takes the cake with water resistance up to 100 meters, IP6X dust resistance, and an additional EN13319 rating for recreational scuba diving up to 40 meters. As far as longevity, it’s hard to make a straight comparison between the brands due to the variety of options available. Some Reddit users say that their Fitbit trackers tend to last around two years, while other Redditors report that their Apple Watch typically lasts four to six years. This is pretty on par with my experience, as I’ve been using a Series 4 Apple Watch since January 2019 with no issues. Will the Google Pixel Watch 2 hold up quite as long? It’s a little too soon to tell. Winner: Apple WatchSmartphone compatibilityYou might be wondering, “Is Fitbit compatible with iPhone?” Honestly, it depends.The Fitbit app is compatible with most popular smartphones — including iOS and Android devices — and all of Fitbit’s products are technically compatible with iPhone, aside from the Google Pixel Watch and the Pixel Watch 2. However, it’s important to note that Fitbit’s other smartwatches (the Versa 4 and the Sense 2) are technically compatible with iPhones, but that doesn’t include many of the additional features like smartphone notifications. That being said, the best option for you depends on your phone. If you use an iPhone, stick with an Apple Watch or one of Fitbit’s activity trackers. If you use an Android device, you can use any of Fitbit’s products, which technically makes Fitbit the winner of this category.Winner: FitbitPrice rangeFitbit’s wider product range means it has a better price range, too. If you’re operating on a budget, that means Fitbit is the way to go. Its activity trackers are quite a bit cheaper than its smartwatches, with the Inspire 3 starting at $99, and its most popular tracker, the Charge 6, clocks in at $159. If you’re looking for a smartwatch, however, the prices are a little more comparable between brands. The Google Pixel Watch 2 starts at $349, making it slightly cheaper than the Apple Watch Series 9 (starts at $399) and slightly more expensive than the Apple Watch SE (starts at $249). Yes, technically, there are more smartwatch options available from Fitbit — the Versa 4 ($199) and the Sense 2 ($249) — but considering they lack app stores, it doesn’t really feel right to put them on the same tier as the Pixel Watch 2 or the Series 9. Fitbit also offers a kid-friendly smartwatch, the Ace LTE ($299), but it requires an additional $9.99 per month data plan.Winner: FitbitOther featuresWhile I enjoyed using Fitbit’s products, there weren’t many standout features that made me love one more than the other. The Pixel Watch 2 is a solid smartwatch, but so is the Series 9, so — again — it really depends on what phone you’re using. As far as activity trackers go, Fitbit had one semi-critical feature missing, at least for fellow gym rats: most of its lineup isn’t compatible with exercise equipment, aside from the Charge 6. This means you can’t connect any of your Fitbit devices — including the Google Pixel Watch 2 — to gym equipment (treadmills, stationary bikes, etc.) to view/sync data like heart rate, calories burned, and distance. Meanwhile, this is a baseline feature in Apple Watches — even my old Series 4 connects to compatible equipment at the gym using NFC functionality — which made it all the more surprising to discover that Fitbit skipped that feature.Is it a dealbreaker? Probably not for most people, but it’s a feature I’ve really loved using on my Apple Watch, so not having it felt weird.Winner: Apple WatchApple Watch vs. Fitbit: The verdictIt’s not exactly the flashiest answer, but the clear winner between Apple Watch and Fitbit depends on you. If you’re looking for a simple fitness tracker, the best Fitbit watch is likely the Charge 6. It packs a powerful punch into a tiny device — including health and fitness tracking, sleep tracking, built-in GPS, and more — while boasting a great battery life and a solid price tag.If you’re more interested in a quality smartwatch, then get whatever works with your phone. The Apple Watch is a fantastic choice that’s both functional and durable, but the Google Pixel Watch 2 is shaping up to be a decent competitor.\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: RJ Andersen / Mashable\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Shop Apple Watches at Amazon\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                                        \n            \n                                                    \n                    Shop Now\n                \n                        \n\n\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: RJ Andersen / Mashable\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Shop Fitbits at Amazon\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                                        \n            \n                                                    \n                    Shop Now"

I remember my high school guidance counselor looking at my grades and suggesting I avoid a career in tech. If I had taken her advice, I wouldn’t be where I am today. My advice to anyone with dyslexia is simple: Be patient with yourself. Learning might take longer, but when it clicks, it clicks. And once you understand something, your ability to build on that knowledge can outpace those around you. \n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            LANDE CEO Ben Herbert\n            Credit: Courtesy LANDE\n        \n    \nBen Herbert is the founder and CEO of LANDE, a digital marketing agency in Columbus, Ohio.

Editor Kimberly Gedeon was impressed by this 16-incher's mid-range performance and build quality, especially its \"super clicky\" keyboard. She also liked its inclusion of a Stealth mode hotkey to dial back its RGB lighting, and its support of Nvidia Advanced Optimus for automatic GPU switching depending on the task. (There's an MUX switch to do it manually, too.) \"The Alienware m16 R2 blends portability and power to deliver a laptop that can handle both play and work,\" she wrote. It snagged a 4.5/5 rating and a Mashable Choice Award.</p><p>The model Gedeon tested featured an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor, RTX 4070 graphics, 16GB of memory, and 1TB of storage. It's currently on sale for $1,499.99 at Best Buy (normally $1,899.99). That's not quite as good as its Black Friday price of $1,299.99, but $400 off is still pretty decent.

She also liked its inclusion of a Stealth mode hotkey to dial back its RGB lighting, and its support of Nvidia Advanced Optimus for automatic GPU switching depending on the task. (There's an MUX switch to do it manually, too.) \"The Alienware m16 R2 blends portability and power to deliver a laptop that can handle both play and work,\" she wrote. It snagged a 4.5/5 rating and a Mashable Choice Award.The model Gedeon tested featured an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor, RTX 4070 graphics, 16GB of memory, and 1TB of storage. It's currently on sale for $1,499.99 at Best Buy (normally $1,899.99). That's not quite as good as its Black Friday price of $1,299.99, but $400 off is still pretty decent. For reference, that same discount made it sell out on Dell's website earlier in the week; it's now back in stock there, but it doesn't ship until late December.Best budget pick\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Acer\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Acer Nitro V 15 (Intel Core i5-13420H, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $599.00\n                                                     at Walmart\n                                                \n                                                                                            $799.00\n                                                                             Save $200.00\n                                                            \n            \n                            Includes free copy of \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\"\n                                            \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nWhy we like itRead Mashable's full review of the Acer Nitro V 15.Another Mashable Choice Award winner, the 2023 Nitro V 15 is our No. 1 budget gaming laptop largely because it's fully capable of handling graphically intense games Cyberpunk 2077 without getting too hot (though its fans will make themselves known). Gedeon also liked its understated design, deeming it \"the perfect balance of fun and serious\"; she rated it a 4.7/5 overall. Its dim 1080p display and its passion for clinging to fingerprints are the two biggest things you'll have to reckon with, but its current sale price might push those cons aside.Walmart has a model with an Intel Core i5-13420H CPU, RTX 4050 graphics, 16GB RAM, and 512GB of storage on sale for just $599, or $200 off — a still-live Cyber Monday deal that includes a free copy of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which is set for release in February. It's slightly pared down compared to the configuration we tested, which had an Intel Core i7-13620H processor and 1TB of storage (but the same GPU), but if it's shipping with that Triple-A game, it should be plenty powerful for most titles.Best splurge\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Asus\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD)\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $1,649.99\n                                                     at Best Buy\n                                                \n                                                                                            $1,999.99\n                                                                             Save $350.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nWhy we like itRead Mashable's full review of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.Thin, light, and understated, this 14-incher \"is perfect for those who want to bring a respectable, MacBook Pro-esque laptop to the office — before gaming at night with a beastly gaming rig,\" Gedeon wrote.

Thankfully, Amazon's still offering some very nice discounts after the big seasonal sale events. If you've had your eye on an Echo Pop to pick up this year, you can grab it at an excellent price right now at the retailer.Amazon's Echo Pop is currently on sale for $17.99, a massive 55% discount off its list price of $39.99. According to price tracker camelcamelcamel, this is also its lowest-ever price so it's well worth taking advantage of. Not to mention, if this was something you had in mind as a gift idea, Amazon notes that it'll arrive 14 days before Christmas so there's no need to worry about delays.\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            The Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) is $60 off at Amazon\n            \n        \n    \nWe also believe this affordable little smart speaker is worth picking up for your home, whether you enjoy blasting music, catching up on podcasts, or getting lost in an audiobook. In our review of the Echo Pop, writer SaVanna Shoemaker said, \"For people who like to keep music playing, and who also use Alexa as a home assistant, the Echo Pop is a perfect addition to any room in the house.\"Amazon has this smart speaker listed as a limited-time deal, so you'll want to act fast to save over 50% on the Echo Pop.While some deals aren't quite as low as they were during Cyber Monday, there are still some offers worth checking out right now at Amazon.

    "sanitized": "Any time you shop for a new laptop, a lot of people are going to tell you the same thing: Get a MacBook.We don't blame them. The best MacBooks are fantastic laptops, and while they don't afford you the freedom of customization that other brands offer, that's not something everyone will care about. Most of us just want a high-quality laptop that'll get us through work, school, and play with minimal fuss. \n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Amazon has one pretty good deal on a 2-in-1 laptop ahead of October Prime Day\n            \n        \n    \nAlthough MacBooks can get a bit pricey — with the latest M4 MacBook Pros reaching into truly frightening territory — they justify the price with Apple's signature design, user-friendly OS, and zippy M-series processors. Plus, you can often find MacBook Air and Pro models on sale (with the cheapest ones priced around $850 to $999).After testing out Apple's entire lineup of laptops, we're here to help you narrow down the choices and take home the Apple machine of your dreams. So, let's start shopping.Your first big decision: MacBook Pro vs. AirWith today's current lineup of MacBooks, you really only have two options: The MacBook Pro or the MacBook Air. So, which is right for you?If you're a creative who regularly pushes your laptop to the limit with demanding video and photo editing applications, you'll want to aim for the Pro. The name of the game with the Pro line is processing power, and the latest iterations are the speediest and most performance-driven yet.\n        \n        \n                                        \n                \n                                            Testing the M1 MacBook Air after its 2020 release.\n                                                                Credit: Zlata Ivleva / Mashable\n                                    \n                    \n        \n                                        \n                \n                                            Testing the super-powered M3 MacBook Pro.\n                                                                Credit: Kimberly Gedeon / Mashable\n                                    \n                    \n    \n\nIf convenience and portability are your top priorities, then the Air will be most suited to you.

    "sanitized": "We’ve already highlighted the very best video games of 2024 — the big-name titles everyone’s talking about. But now, it’s time to shine a light on something different.These games flew under the radar, overshadowed by juggernauts like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth. While they may not have had the same massive marketing push, you could argue they’re just as good — maybe even better. In fact, one of these titles made it onto both lists.\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            The best video games of 2024\n            \n        \n    \nSo, let’s give these hidden gems their moment in the spotlight. Here are the best video games of 2024 that you might have missed.Lorelei and the Laser Eyes\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            This one has such a striking look.\n            Credit: Simogo/Steam\n        \n    \nFirst up is Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, a mind-bending puzzle game with a mildly alliterative title that’s fun to say aloud. The less said about this game before you hop into it yourself, the better. All you need to know is that this puzzle game is set inside a black-and-white mansion with fixed camera angles that call back to classic horror games like the original Resident Evil, though you won’t be shooting any zombies here. Instead, you'll solve puzzles. Lots of them. Puzzles will have puzzles inside of them, and they’ll all lead to more puzzles. You may need to have a notepad next to you while you play. It’s that kind of game. Have fun!Ys X: Nordics\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            Ahoy.\n            Credit: Falcom/Steam\n        \n    \nYs X: Nordics isn't technically an indie game like most of the other titles on this list. It comes from a noted Japanese development studio in Falcom, and the Ys series of action RPGs has been around for as long as Final Fantasy. It just doesn't have the same level of prestige, especially in the West. Ys deserves it, though, and selfishly, I want other people I know to play it so I can talk to them about it.Ys X takes the kind of fast-paced, no-thoughts-head-empty action combat the series is known for and adds tactical, defensive layers on top of it to make it deeper and feel more novel than its immediate predecessors. Series protagonist Adol Christin (he's just a guy who loves adventure and has no other personality traits to speak of) is joined on this adventure by a cool Viking lady named Karja, and together, the two of them sail the high seas trying to break an evil curse, among other things.It's got great music, an eminently satisfying upgrade loop, and the best seafaring ship combat this side of Assassin's Creed. Don’t miss this one.Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            I love this little dude.\n            Credit: snekflat/Steam\n        \n    \nI love video games that you can finish in just one or two sittings. I also love the PlayStation 2-era open-world classic The Simpsons: Hit & Run. Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip takes only a few hours to complete. You play as a goofy little guy running around a goofy, open-ended town, completing tasks to upgrade his car and ultimately fly to space. Like Hit & Run, it’s a lighthearted, cartoony, open-world driving adventure with very low stakes and an endearing sense of humor. It's a perfect Steam Deck game, too. The only downside is that it's exclusive to PC right now. UFO 50\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            Yes, games used to look like this, kids.\n            Credit: Mossmouth/Steam\n        \n    \nEagle-eyed readers may remember UFO 50's placement on our main GOTY list this year. I felt it warranted a second mention.This is a collection of 50 fake retro games made by a fictional company in the game and by a gaggle of talented indie developers in real life. It spans several eras of classic game design, from obtuse 8-bit adventures to RPGs and more. UFO 50 is a celebration of what games used to be and paints a positive view of what games can be in the future. Just check it out, will ya?1000xResist\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            Another awesome art style here.\n            Credit: sunset visitor/Steam\n        \n    \n1000xResist is another one where the less you know going in, the better.Just know that this unique sci-fi adventure game trades more in compelling narrative than deep mechanics.

It's funny, weird, and has a great look. That earns it a spot on this list.I Am Your Beast\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            Sometimes you just need to let off some steam.\n            Credit: Strange Scaffold/Steam\n        \n    \nSo far, the games on this list have mostly been skewed more lightheartedly or narrative-focused.

If you prefer reading near a body of water &mdash; whether in the bath, by the pool, or at the beach &mdash; that immediately narrows down your options. Among the Kindles, your waterproof options are the Kindle Paperwhite, Paperwhite Signature Edition, Colorsoft Signature Edition, and Paperwhite Kids.</p><p>Beyond whether or not you need a waterproof device, here are a few other things to consider: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Display size:</strong> The smallest Kindle has a 6-inch display, while the largest has a 10.2-inch display.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage capacity:</strong> Kindles range from 16GB to 32GB of storage capacity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Battery life:</strong> Kindles generally have outstanding battery life (depending on your usage).

Kindles are also equipped with WiFi connectivity, allowing you to download all the reading material you could ever want. Plus, you can listen to audiobooks on Audible via any Kindle's built-in Bluetooth connection.</p><p>Not to mention, out of all the e-readers I've tested, Kindles have the best compatibility with Libby. I love the digital platform because I can read for free and support my local library. Some other e-readers require you to download your library e-book to a computer and then upload it to an e-reader, but with Kindles, your e-books are sent straight to your device with a click.</p><div id=\"related-video\" class=\"mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-row justify-center text-lg text-center md:text-xl\">\n        <hr class=\"mx-auto border border-gray-100\">\n        <strong class=\"py-4 mx-4 w-full min-w-max text-2xl\">Featured Video For You</strong>\n        <hr class=\"mx-auto border border-gray-100\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"mx-auto mt-5 max-w-2xl\">\n        <div id=\"video-container-06EY98Loo67CWfsAE87ezsr\"></div>\n        \n        <div id=\"video-title-container-06EY98Loo67CWfsAE87ezsr\" class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl text-lg font-semibold leading-5 md:leading-6\">Kindle Paperwhite vs. Kobo Clara Colour: Which one is better?</div>\n    </div>\n    <hr class=\"mx-auto w-full border border-gray-100\" style=\"max-width:48rem !important;\">\n</div>",
    "sanitized": "If you're ready to stop lugging around your hardcovers and paperbacks and ready to put your whole library in your pocket, it's time to get a Kindle. The e-reader market has expanded fervently over the past few years, and I'm not saying BookTok is to blame, but I'm not not saying that's the case.All over the internet, you'll find TikTok users enthusiastically singing the praises of Amazon's e-readers and their hacks for finding discounted books through events like Stuff Your Kindle Day or remote page-turners, so you don't need to hold your Kindle while reading. And I'm with these extolling users: a Kindle brings your reading experience to the next level. They're lightweight, easy to use, and compatible with Libby, so you can still support your local library. If you don't need much convincing, it's just a matter of picking which Kindle you want.Plus, we're gearing up for the holidays. While the big shopping holidays like Prime Day and Black Friday have already come to pass, Amazon is still running sales on a couple of our favorite Kindles. With deals out there for the taking, you can gift one to a family member without cashing in your 401(k), or get one for yourself as a little literary treat and spend the holidays cozied up on the sofa, crossing out those final titles to make your yearly reading goal happen.\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            I've read 34 books this year and these are my favorite e-readers\n            \n        \n    \nA lot has changed since the Kindle first debuted in 2007. While it was released just a few months after the first iPhone, the Amazon Kindle has received fewer updates. As of 2024, we're on the 12th generation of Kindle updates; the latest arrived in October 2024. I got my hands on Amazon's 2024 models to see what they offer.Kindle's first color e-reader is here as of Oct. 30, 2024, however, it's been backordered for several weeks, and we've yet to get our hands on it. I'm eager to finally see how it compares — especially with the Kobo Libra Colour. Plus, as of Dec. 4, the redesigned Kindle Scribe is now out there for the annotators, and has four times the storage as the past model.\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            The new Kindle Colorsoft is available to purchase as of Oct. 30, 2024.\n            Credit: Amazon\n        \n    \nWhen is the best time to buy a Kindle?Because Kindles are one of Amazon's cornerstone products, you'll often see their prices drop during Amazon's annual sales, which usually take place in the summer and fall of each year. In 2024, Prime Day took place on July 16 and 17, and Prime Big Deal Days ran Oct. 8 and 9.The next shopping holidays you should focus on are Black Friday and Cyber Monday. On these momentous occasions, we've seen Kindles marked down by up to 40%. We even saw the brand-new 2024 Kindle models drop in price during Cyber Week this year.We're seeing a few Kindles continue to run sales up to 19% off into mid-December. So if you missed Black Friday, there's still a chance.What is the right Kindle to buy?If you're concerned about buying the newest tech, that's not an issue.

    "sanitized": "Google's annual Year in Search is always a fascinating look at what we’re exploring online, but one of the more overlooked trends is what we’re humming to find on the internet.Hum to Search, a lesser-known but delightful feature of Google’s search engine, is both entertaining and incredibly useful. So much so that Google has compiled a list of the 10 most hummed songs in the US and worldwide, a perfect nod to all of us who can’t shake that earworm and need a little help identifying it.Here's the top 3:1. \"Beautiful Things\" by Benson Boone\n    \n\n\n\nIt’s no surprise that Benson Boone’s pop ballad clinched the number one spot on both the US and global top 10 Hum to Search lists. The Washington-raised singer-songwriter went viral on TikTok this year during the rollout and release of “Beautiful Things,” amassing over 4.1 million videos created with the track.With more than 1.6 billion streams on Spotify, “Beautiful Things” has become one of the year’s most-played songs, even earning Boone a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. It’s easy to see why this track has been stuck in so many heads.2. \"Axel F\" by Crazy Frog\n    \n\n\n\nThe Crazy Frog remix of “Axel F” had its moment back in the quirky days of 2005 (not to make you feel old, but I was seven then). However, thanks to a wave of nostalgia sparked by Netflix for the release of Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, the viral hit has made a surprising comeback.To be fair, it was the best-selling ringtone of its time and has somehow maintained its odd cultural grip on Americans, at least. Strangely enough, “Axel F” didn’t manage to secure a spot in the global top 10.3. \"Wellerman\" by Santiano\n    \n\n\n\nTikTok has been obsessed with “Wellerman” and other sea shanties for a couple of years, but it’s surprising to see Santiano’s version of “Wellerman” break into the top three. The popular New Zealand folk song first went viral in 2021 after Scottish singer Nathan Evans’s cover, sparking hundreds of subsequent renditions.\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Youtube Music 2024 recap: How to get yours\n            \n        \n    \nIt seems that, much like how Pandora operates, Google’s Hum to Search feature relies on its database for matches.
