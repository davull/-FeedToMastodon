However, this dispute over definitions has been vital to the battle for net neutrality, as telecommunications carriers are subject to heavier regulatory oversight under the Communications Act. For example, while telecommunications carriers are required to charge their customers <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/967/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory rates</a>, information services aren't beholden to such rules.</p><p>Yet despite the difference in how each is treated, the distinction between information and telecommunications services is frequently unclear.&nbsp;</p><p>As defined by the Communications Act, an information service is \"the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications, and includes electronic publishing.\" Meanwhile, a telecommunications service is \"the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the facilities used.\"</p><p>In Griffin's estimation, \"an 'information service' manipulates data, while a 'telecommunications service' does not.\"&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-405431A1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">The FCC argued</a> that third parties which create their own content are information services, such as <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/netflix\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/amazon\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Amazon</a>, and <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/google\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Google</a>. In comparison, it considered ISPs which connect such third parties with users to be telecommunications services, like <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/verizon\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Verizon</a>, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/t-mobile-starlink-launch-beta-program-satellite-connectivity\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">T-Mobile</a>, and <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/att\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">AT&amp;T</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the court disagreed. Employing a broad definition of the term \"capability,\" Griffin reasoned that because ISPs \"provide a user with the 'capability' to, at minimum, 'retrieve' third-party content,\" they are to be considered information services.</p><p>\"[A] provider need not <em>itself</em> generate, process, retrieve, or otherwise manipulate information in order to provide an 'information service,'\" wrote Griffin (emphasis original). \"Instead, a provider need only offer the '<em>capability</em>' of manipulating information&hellip; to offer an 'information service'.\"</p><p>Thursday's finding relied upon <a href=\"https://www.wiley.law/alert-Supreme-Court-Overturns-Chevron-Deference-in-Loper-Bright-Decision\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">a landmark Supreme Court decision from last year</a> which weakened the power of government agencies. Previously, courts deferred to such agencies' reasonable interpretations of ambiguous laws. Now courts no longer have to follow this principle.</p><h2>The partisan history of net neutrality in the U.S.</h2><p>Whether the FCC has regarded ISPs as providing information services or telecommunication services has significantly fluctuated depending upon which political party is in power. (The FCC is directed by five commissioners who are <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/about-fcc/what-we-do\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">appointed by the president,</a> confirmed by the Senate, and serve five-year terms.)</p><p>Under Democratic President Barack Obama in 2015, the FCC determined that ISPs are telecommunication carriers and thus fall under its jurisdiction. This allowed the agency to introduce net neutrality laws. The FCC <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/net-neturality-fcc-vote\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">subsequently reversed</a> this determination during Republican President Donald Trump's term, considering ISPs information services and thus lifting net neutrality requirements.</p><p>Last April, the FCC <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/fcc-net-neutrality-law\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">attempted to bring back net neutrality</a> under Democratic President Joe Biden.

    "sanitized": "Net neutrality is dead once more. A U.S. Court of Appeals has killed the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) attempt to reinstate open internet rules, finding that the government agency doesn't have the legal authority to do so.In a 26-page opinion filed on Thursday, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that internet service providers (ISPs) offer an \"information service\" rather than a \"telecommunications service\" under the Communications Act of 1934. As such, they are not subject to the latter's stricter FCC regulation, meaning the agency has no power to bring back net neutrality laws.\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Where Trump's FCC chair nominee Brendan Carr stands on net neutrality\n            \n        \n    \n\"As Congress has said, the Internet has 'flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of government regulation,'\" wrote Circuit Judge Richard Allen Griffin, quoting 47 U.S.C. § 230(a)(4). Net neutrality rules prevent ISPs from controlling how users access the internet, prohibiting tactics such as throttling internet speeds, blocking legal websites, or charging more for access to certain ones. Opponents claim that net neutrality would reduce innovation and investment in broadband technologies. Advocates argue that net neutrality provides everyone with equal access to the internet, regardless of their position in life.\"[O]pen access to essential networks is an age-old proposition,\" former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler wrote in 2023. \"The issue… is whether those that run the most powerful and pervasive platform in the history of the planet will be accountable for behaving in a 'just and reasonable' manner… [and] why such an important pathway on which so many Americans rely should be without a public interest requirement and appropriate oversight.\"The FCC cannot reintroduce net neutrality laws, court rulesThe classification of ISPs may seem like a matter of nitpicking and semantics. However, this dispute over definitions has been vital to the battle for net neutrality, as telecommunications carriers are subject to heavier regulatory oversight under the Communications Act. For example, while telecommunications carriers are required to charge their customers just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory rates, information services aren't beholden to such rules.Yet despite the difference in how each is treated, the distinction between information and telecommunications services is frequently unclear. As defined by the Communications Act, an information service is \"the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications, and includes electronic publishing.\" Meanwhile, a telecommunications service is \"the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the facilities used.\"In Griffin's estimation, \"an 'information service' manipulates data, while a 'telecommunications service' does not.\" The FCC argued that third parties which create their own content are information services, such as Netflix, Amazon, and Google. In comparison, it considered ISPs which connect such third parties with users to be telecommunications services, like Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T.Unfortunately, the court disagreed. Employing a broad definition of the term \"capability,\" Griffin reasoned that because ISPs \"provide a user with the 'capability' to, at minimum, 'retrieve' third-party content,\" they are to be considered information services.\"[A] provider need not itself generate, process, retrieve, or otherwise manipulate information in order to provide an 'information service,'\" wrote Griffin (emphasis original). \"Instead, a provider need only offer the 'capability' of manipulating information… to offer an 'information service'.\"Thursday's finding relied upon a landmark Supreme Court decision from last year which weakened the power of government agencies. Previously, courts deferred to such agencies' reasonable interpretations of ambiguous laws. Now courts no longer have to follow this principle.The partisan history of net neutrality in the U.S.Whether the FCC has regarded ISPs as providing information services or telecommunication services has significantly fluctuated depending upon which political party is in power. (The FCC is directed by five commissioners who are appointed by the president, confirmed by the Senate, and serve five-year terms.)Under Democratic President Barack Obama in 2015, the FCC determined that ISPs are telecommunication carriers and thus fall under its jurisdiction. This allowed the agency to introduce net neutrality laws. The FCC subsequently reversed this determination during Republican President Donald Trump's term, considering ISPs information services and thus lifting net neutrality requirements.Last April, the FCC attempted to bring back net neutrality under Democratic President Joe Biden. This effort was blocked after industry groups obtained an injunction against the order. Now it seems that this attempt to revive net neutrality will die in court.Theoretically, the FCC could appeal Thursday’s finding to the Supreme Court. Even so, it’s unlikely the agency will take this step considering Trump resumes office in a few weeks.“Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair,” FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement following the court's decision. \"With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law.”"

The wingtip ensures a snug but comfortable experience so you'll be set for taking these from the gym to the office. The IPX-4 sweat and water resistance rating means the Beats Fit Pro are ready for your spin class or for an outdoor walk in rainy winter weather. Beats allows you to choose between three listening modes with the Beats Fit Pro: active noise cancelling, transparency mode, and adaptive EQ. In 2021, Mashable reporter Alex Perry reviewed the Beats Fit Pro saying, \"Apple may not put its name directly on any Beats products, but the Beats Fit Pro are so much better than the new AirPods that maybe they should start doing that.\"With praise like that, it's worth considering the sale price of $159.99 at Amazon which shaves 20% off the normal price of $199.95."

Where are the cars?</span>\n            <span class=\"text-gray-600 credit\">Credit: Apple</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>This is perhaps the most straightforward omission. Apple has long been working on the next generation of CarPlay. In the company's own words, it's \"the ultimate iPhone experience for the car,\" as it basically takes over the car's infotainment and instrument cluster and turns it into a \"cohesive design experience that is the very best of your car and your iPhone.\"</p><p>While the CarPlay of today is adequate, it still feels oddly disconnected from the rest of the car's user interface. But this new generation of CarPlay sounds like it could bring us as close to the fabled Apple Car as we're ever going to get, given that the company reportedly <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/apple-ev-killed\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">stopped working on the projec</a>t after a decade of development. </p><p>The problem? The first cars with this new CarPlay were supposed to arrive in 2024, but didn't. It's not just wishful thinking on our part, either: Apple explicitly said so. In fact, the company's CarPlay site still says that the \"first models arrive in 2024\". Sorry to be a bummer, but 2024 is over, so hopefully the new CarPlay-equipped models will arrive soon. When it does happen, we expect it to be in a <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/porsche-taycan-2025-refresh\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Porsche</a>, which has been working to integrate the latest CarPlay functionality into its upcoming models. </p><h2>Spotify's hi-fi tier</h2><p>Spotify's hi-fi subscription tier is one of the weirdest tech stories in recent years. The company originally announced it in <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/spotify-hifi-lossless-audio\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">February 2021</a> (yes, nearly four years ago), and, at the time, it seemed like a logical step up to compete with Amazon, Apple, and Tidal, all of which offered high-fidelity streaming on their music services. </p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05OM43C9zs2CM4boe6jTNuF/images-2.fill.size_2000x1107.v1735817580.png\" alt=\"Spotify Hi-Fi\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1107\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05OM43C9zs2CM4boe6jTNuF/images-2.fill.size_800x443.v1735817580.png 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05OM43C9zs2CM4boe6jTNuF/images-2.fill.size_1400x775.v1735817580.png 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05OM43C9zs2CM4boe6jTNuF/images-2.fill.size_2000x1107.v1735817580.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n\n\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2 subtitle-2 font-sans \">\n            <span class=\"normal-case text-gray-1000\">Ah, the sweet sound of Spotify Hi-Fi not launching yet another year after it was promised.</span>\n            <span class=\"text-gray-600 credit\">Credit: Spotify</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Fast forward a couple of years, and Spotify launched nothing of the sort, while stubbornly maintaining that something akin to a hi-fi subscription tier is eventually coming (it may, however, be called Spotify <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/spotifiy-hifi-supremium\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Supremium</a>, or something else entirely). </p><p>Right now, there's no launch date for the service (well, if you don't count the \"later this year\" which is what <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-22/five-things-to-know-about-spotify-hifi/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Spotify said in 2021</a>), and the details are still very murky. Last we've heard on the matter was from Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, who <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q3-2024-spotify-technology-sa-121935633.html?guccounter=2&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGN3b3JsZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS83OTA4ODIvc3BvdGlmeS1oaWZpLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS1wcmljaW5nLmh0bWw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADyrluUKmAvyoSjlI37KMzPKy1HCHMf3bzYMQbuuH1Rqg0Teht3Rk4jAZaUBotrCcmUHHRQnnTJfVALdBNnBPYE9fLvNIbWHBifELsO_PPIPG589Rig-Hv9KeuJEd9agE-tlKgPRmCPzB6Cw1j2cXzZ1PSPwNi6PoPB365I86f-S\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">said</a> that a \"deluxe version of Spotify\" with \"better sound\" is coming, but he wouldn't share when.

    "sanitized": "2024 was a huge year for tech, with artificial intelligence fast becoming the most promising tech advancement since, well, perhaps the internet itself. We also saw a ton of incredible new gadgets, laptops, phones, tablets, electric vehicles, and yes, even a few cool new robots.What we didn't see, however, is a couple of services and products that were promised for 2024, but simply never saw the light of day, or were postponed into 2025 and beyond. We waited and waited, and now that the year is done and 2025 is most definitely here, it's time to do a recap of the stuff we didn't get this year. Apple's next-gen CarPlay\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            Erm, 2024 is over, folks. Where are the cars?\n            Credit: Apple\n        \n    \nThis is perhaps the most straightforward omission. Apple has long been working on the next generation of CarPlay. In the company's own words, it's \"the ultimate iPhone experience for the car,\" as it basically takes over the car's infotainment and instrument cluster and turns it into a \"cohesive design experience that is the very best of your car and your iPhone.\"While the CarPlay of today is adequate, it still feels oddly disconnected from the rest of the car's user interface. But this new generation of CarPlay sounds like it could bring us as close to the fabled Apple Car as we're ever going to get, given that the company reportedly stopped working on the project after a decade of development. The problem? The first cars with this new CarPlay were supposed to arrive in 2024, but didn't. It's not just wishful thinking on our part, either: Apple explicitly said so. In fact, the company's CarPlay site still says that the \"first models arrive in 2024\". Sorry to be a bummer, but 2024 is over, so hopefully the new CarPlay-equipped models will arrive soon. When it does happen, we expect it to be in a Porsche, which has been working to integrate the latest CarPlay functionality into its upcoming models. Spotify's hi-fi tierSpotify's hi-fi subscription tier is one of the weirdest tech stories in recent years. The company originally announced it in February 2021 (yes, nearly four years ago), and, at the time, it seemed like a logical step up to compete with Amazon, Apple, and Tidal, all of which offered high-fidelity streaming on their music services. \n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            Ah, the sweet sound of Spotify Hi-Fi not launching yet another year after it was promised.\n            Credit: Spotify\n        \n    \nFast forward a couple of years, and Spotify launched nothing of the sort, while stubbornly maintaining that something akin to a hi-fi subscription tier is eventually coming (it may, however, be called Spotify Supremium, or something else entirely). Right now, there's no launch date for the service (well, if you don't count the \"later this year\" which is what Spotify said in 2021), and the details are still very murky. Last we've heard on the matter was from Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, who said that a \"deluxe version of Spotify\" with \"better sound\" is coming, but he wouldn't share when. Well, it certainly won't happen in 2024. Tesla's cheaper car, Robotaxi, and unsupervised FSDThe fact that we didn't get any of the above in 2024 hardly surprised anyone, given that Tesla CEO publicly said they're all coming in 2025 and beyond. But it's worth revisiting the topic, as the fabled super-affordable Tesla, the self-driving, people-hauling Tesla Robotaxi, and a version of Tesla's full-self driving (FSD) software that can drive the car autonomously, were all promised for 2024 (or earlier) at some point. For example, Musk said in 2020 that Tesla could launch a $25,000 car by 2023. The idea saw much back and forth over the years, with Musk recently giving up on the idea of a \"$25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model,\" while at the same time promising a \"more affordable\" Tesla in the first half of 2025. Per Musk, Tesla Robotaxis were supposed to roam the streets as early as 2020; now the actual Robotaxi (or CyberCab, we're not sure about the name) model has been revealed, and is scheduled to launch in 2026. \n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n    \n\nFinally, unsupervised FSD, which should bring newer Teslas to the point at which they can drive themselves without the need of a human driver's intervention, is now scheduled for 2025, even though it was originally promised way, way earlier than that. The last widely available, supervised version of FSD launched very late in 2024, and reports indicate the company may finally be close to nailing it."

What's more, it recently got a welcome bump to 16GB of base RAM.Among Windows PCs, the Lenovo Yoga 7i 14 (Gen 9) is currently the best laptop under $1,000 that we've tried. It has a peppy processor and a good battery life, it doubles as a tablet, and it starts at $899.99.If you're really into Microsoft machines, look into the Surface Laptop Go 3. The company's current cheapest offering is a super portable notebook with a chic look and a clicky keyboard — though I'd encourage shoppers to find it on sale, given its older CPU. It otherwise starts at $799.99.\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            The best laptops we tested in 2024: Did Apple's latest MacBook make the cut?\n            \n        \n    \nThe best cheap Chromebook is the $499 HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch, with its big, vibrant display and competent everyday performance. It also supports some useful AI features and multimedia editing apps.Cheap gaming laptops don't get much better than the Acer Nitro V 15, which combines a cool design with cool Triple-A performance for $999 as tested. (The base model is only $749.) We also recommend the Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE as an even cheaper \"cheap gaming laptop\" pick: It streams high-end titles well, comes with a really nice 120Hz display, and retails for only $649.Other cheap laptops on our radarWe currently have the Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 in hand for testing (specifically, the 2023 model with a 12th-generation Intel processor priced at $399.99). If it feels like a better value than HP's Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch, it could be a new \"best cheap Chromebook\" contender.We'll also test the Asus Vivobook S 14, a new Copilot+ PC with a Lunar Lake CPU and an OLED display, as well as the latest Framework Laptop 13, a repairable laptop that seems like a solid long-term value. We were big fans of an older version.Mashable staff will be keeping a close eye out for further contenders while we walk around the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January. While most of the laptops announced at the huge tech trade show are typically premium picks with innovative features, we might see some next-gen budget options from brands like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo.Read on for Mashable's in-depth guide to the best cheap laptops of 2024. FYI: We've listed the pricing and specs of our testing units, which may not apply to each laptop's base model."

That's 18% in savings. Compared to previous iterations, the Series 10 features a thinner and lighter build, a larger display with a built-in speaker, faster charging (one of the biggest selling points for our reviewer), and new health and fitness features like sleep apnea alerts, water temperature, and depth sensing. We wish there were bigger upgrades, but all in all, it still holds up as one of our favorite smartwatches and fitness trackers.</p><p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/review/apple-watch-series-10\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><em>Check out Mashable's full review of the Apple Watch Series 10.</em></a></p><h2>Amazon Echo Buds</h2><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div class=\"mx-auto w-64 md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                                                        <a class=\"block group\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/QPpAoA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=image&element_label=image&object_type=article&object_uuid=00ZkgzUa3rDpKnWPN8cHXZl&short_url=QPpAoA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click>\n                                                                            <img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00ZkgzUa3rDpKnWPN8cHXZl/images-7.fill.size_183x256.v1735657454.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Echo Buds in white with charging case\" width=\"183\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\n                        \n                        <div class=\"block relative mx-14 group-hover:visible tooltip\">\n                    <span class=\"absolute invisible p-1 mt-2 text-xs text-center text-white group-hover:visible tooltiptext bg-gray-600/0 group-hover:bg-gray-600/100\">\n                        Opens in a new window\n                    </span>\n                        </div>\n                                            </a>\n                                <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                            <span class=\"pr-5 mt-1 text-xs text-gray-600 subtitle-2\">Credit: Amazon</span>\n                                    </div>\n                        </div>\n    <div class=\"pl-0 mt-3 w-full md:pr-10 md:pl-7 md:mt-0 md:w-2/3\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QPpAoA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=title&element_label=Amazon%20Echo%20Buds&object_type=article&object_uuid=00ZkgzUa3rDpKnWPN8cHXZl&short_url=QPpAoA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\" class=\"block mb-5 text-xl font-bold leading-8 text-center md:text-2xl md:text-left hover:underline text-secondary-300\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Amazon Echo Buds\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    Amazon Echo Buds\n                </a>\n                                        <div class=\"flex justify-between items-center py-0 md:space-x-2\">\n                <div class=\"md:w-2/3\" style=\"line-height: 0.75rem\">\n                                            <span class=\"text-sm font-bold\">$24.99</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"text-xs\"> at Amazon</span>\n                                                <br>\n                                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold line-through\">$49.99</span>\n                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold text-red-400\"> Save $25.00</span>\n                                                            </div>\n            </div>\n                                                    <a class=\"font-bold leading-6 text-center hover:underline\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/QPpAoA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=buy-button&element_label=Get%20Deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=00ZkgzUa3rDpKnWPN8cHXZl&short_url=QPpAoA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"Get Deal\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    <button class=\"inline-block px-5 mt-3 w-full font-sans text-base font-bold tracking-wide md:w-auto md:text-lg btn btn-secondary\">Get Deal</button>\n                </a>\n                        </div>\n</div>\n<p>The budget-friendly Echo Buds from 2023 completely overhauled the design of the previous version. They're very simple earbuds, but they hold their own &mdash;&nbsp;especially at sub-$50 price point. They don't offer noise cancellation or have the most comfortable fit on the market, but they sound great, last up to 20 hours, are simple to use, and seamlessly pair with your other Alexa gadgets.

Sure, we're not even into 2025 yet, but it's time to start thinking about filing your taxes. If you plan on filing your own taxes, this deal on TurboTax Deluxe can help you save some money and stress. The Deluxe software is recommended for homeowners, those with high medical expenses, and those who make multiple charitable donations per year who need to file both federal and state returns.

Our friends over at PCMag (which is also owned by Ziff Davis) named it \"Amazon's top smart speaker for children\" and gave it the <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-echo-pop-kids\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">PCMag Editor's Choice</a> badge of honor. It only comes in Disney-licensed designs &mdash; Disney princess or Marvel &mdash; but if you've got a kid who loves Disney, you're in luck. It's usually $49.99, but it's on sale for just $22.99. That's a savings of 54%, which is still its lowest price on record.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

The Series 10 hit its best price ever during Cyber Week and post-holiday madness, it's back at that same price. Snag the 42mm, GPS version for just $329 instead of $399 or the 46mm, GPS version for just $359 instead of $429. That's 18% in savings. Compared to previous iterations, the Series 10 features a thinner and lighter build, a larger display with a built-in speaker, faster charging (one of the biggest selling points for our reviewer), and new health and fitness features like sleep apnea alerts, water temperature, and depth sensing. We wish there were bigger upgrades, but all in all, it still holds up as one of our favorite smartwatches and fitness trackers.Check out Mashable's full review of the Apple Watch Series 10.Amazon Echo Buds\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Amazon\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Amazon Echo Buds\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $24.99\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $49.99\n                                                                             Save $25.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nThe budget-friendly Echo Buds from 2023 completely overhauled the design of the previous version. They're very simple earbuds, but they hold their own — especially at sub-$50 price point. They don't offer noise cancellation or have the most comfortable fit on the market, but they sound great, last up to 20 hours, are simple to use, and seamlessly pair with your other Alexa gadgets. As Mashable reviewer SaVanna Shoemaker noted, \"For the price, the Echo Buds are a solid pair of wireless earbuds.\" Snag 'em while they're still sitting at their record-low of $24.99. That's 50% in savings.Check out our full review of the Amazon Echo Buds.Cricut Hat Press\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Cricut\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Cricut Hat Smart Heat Press Machine\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $79.00\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $149.00\n                                                                             Save $70.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nLooking to jumpstart a new hobby in 2025?

    "sanitized": "A data leak at Volkswagen software subsidiary Cariad exposed personal data, including location data, of hundreds of thousands of electric vehicle owners, according to a report from Der Spiegel. The leak was discovered by an unnamed whistleblower, who shared the vulnerability with the Chaos Computer Club (a European hacker association) and Der Spiegel. The outlet was then able to test that the leak is real by tracking the cars of German politicians Nadja Weippert and Markus Grübel, who agreed to have their data accessed by reporters. \n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            CES 2025: 5 car trends we expect to see\n            \n        \n    \nThe leak affected roughly 800,000 Volkswagen, Audi, Seat, and Skoda electric cars, but for roughly 460,000 of them, including Volkswagen's ID.3 and ID.4 models, the data was very detailed, and included locations where the car was switched on and off. According to the report, accessing this data was fairly easy and did not require very complex hacking methods. The data was apparently stored in unprotected and unencrypted Amazon cloud storage. Some of the people affected by the leak include German politicians, business leaders, and the Hamburg police. Der Spiegel notified Cariad about the leak, which was subsequently patched. Fortunately, while the leak enabled basically anyone to track EV owners' locations for months, there is no evidence of anyone having done that. Cariad told Der Spiegel that EV owners don't need to take any steps to protect their data from prying eyes. As for Volkswagen, the company claims that accessing the data was not as easy as it seemed, and that it required \"a high level of expertise and a considerable investment of time.\"\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Volkswagen makes huge bet on electric vehicles\n            \n        \n    \nStill, this is a major embarrassment for the German automaker, which has barely recovered from the 2015 Dieselgate scandal, in which it was discovered that the company programmed some of its diesel engines to show lower emissions during laboratory testing than they would have in normal use.

It's not as fancy as the Omni series, but it's a solid pick for most people. It's equipped with 4K Ultra HD entertainment with HDR 10, on-board Alexa, and four HDMI inputs for connectivity. And if you're already using a Fire TV Stick, it'll have your custom-arranged apps waiting for you when you login to your Amazon account. The 43-inch model is regularly $369.99, but as of Dec. 30, Prime members can score it for only $209.99 with the code FIRE43.

It's not overly packed with features and lacks spatial audio, but for the price, it's pretty solid. Plus, as of Dec. 30, it's bundled with the Roku Wireless Subwoofer for only $139.98. Together with the soundbar, the subwoofer can add depth and dimension to your music and movies. It's easy to setup and can slide into most spaces for an extra bass kick.

Do yourself a favor and snag an air purifier to breathe easier this season. The Blueair 311i+ Max can remove at least 99.97 percent of tiny airborne particles to improve the air in spaces up to 1,116 square feet. Its intuitive display features a five-color AQI and simple two-button design to control fan speed and brightness. Plus, it's equipped with Alexa and pairs with the Blueair smart air purifier app for scheduling, monitoring, and more. It's usually $299.99, but as of Dec. 30, you can snag it for just $179.99 at Amazon. That's 40% in savings.</p><h2>Roborock S8 Pro Ultra</h2><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div class=\"mx-auto w-64 md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                                                        <a class=\"block group\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/QrXOp1?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=image&element_label=image&object_type=article&object_uuid=01KZIdTXtRUvuuOhaWGV70S&short_url=QrXOp1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"5\" data-ga-click>\n                                                                            <img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01KZIdTXtRUvuuOhaWGV70S/images-9.fill.size_253x256.v1735570976.jpg\" alt=\"Roborock s8 pro ultra\" width=\"253\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\n                        \n                        <div class=\"block relative mx-14 group-hover:visible tooltip\">\n                    <span class=\"absolute invisible p-1 mt-2 text-xs text-center text-white group-hover:visible tooltiptext bg-gray-600/0 group-hover:bg-gray-600/100\">\n                        Opens in a new window\n                    </span>\n                        </div>\n                                            </a>\n                                <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                            <span class=\"pr-5 mt-1 text-xs text-gray-600 subtitle-2\">Credit: Roborock</span>\n                                    </div>\n                        </div>\n    <div class=\"pl-0 mt-3 w-full md:pr-10 md:pl-7 md:mt-0 md:w-2/3\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QrXOp1?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=title&element_label=Robrock%20S8%20Pro%20Ultra%20robot%20vacuum%20and%20mop&object_type=article&object_uuid=01KZIdTXtRUvuuOhaWGV70S&short_url=QrXOp1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\" class=\"block mb-5 text-xl font-bold leading-8 text-center md:text-2xl md:text-left hover:underline text-secondary-300\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Robrock S8 Pro Ultra robot vacuum and mop\" data-ga-position=\"5\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    Robrock S8 Pro Ultra robot vacuum and mop\n                </a>\n                                        <div class=\"flex justify-between items-center py-0 md:space-x-2\">\n                <div class=\"md:w-2/3\" style=\"line-height: 0.75rem\">\n                                            <span class=\"text-sm font-bold\">$899.99</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"text-xs\"> at Amazon</span>\n                                                <br>\n                                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold line-through\">$1,599.99</span>\n                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold text-red-400\"> Save $700.00</span>\n                                                            </div>\n            </div>\n                                                    <a class=\"font-bold leading-6 text-center hover:underline\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/QrXOp1?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=buy-button&element_label=Get%20Deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=01KZIdTXtRUvuuOhaWGV70S&short_url=QrXOp1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"Get Deal\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"5\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    <button class=\"inline-block px-5 mt-3 w-full font-sans text-base font-bold tracking-wide md:w-auto md:text-lg btn btn-secondary\">Get Deal</button>\n                </a>\n                        </div>\n</div>\n<p>With self-washing and self-drying mopping pads, above-average suction power, reactive 3D obstacle avoidance, floor type customization, and liftable brushes and mopping pads that adapt to different tasks, the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra is packed with features.

Not to mention, our friends at PCMag (also owned by Ziff Davis) called it \"an excellent fitness-focused smartwatch with welcome design improvements over the last generation.\" It lacks widespread app access and ECG and stress sensors, but it makes up for it with its huge selection of built-in fitness features, notable design and usability upgrades, and responsive touch screen. It's usually $199.95, but it's on sale at Amazon as of Dec. 30 for just $149.95.

It's not as fancy as the Omni series, but it's a solid pick for most people. It's equipped with 4K Ultra HD entertainment with HDR 10, on-board Alexa, and four HDMI inputs for connectivity. And if you're already using a Fire TV Stick, it'll have your custom-arranged apps waiting for you when you login to your Amazon account. The 43-inch model is regularly $369.99, but as of Dec. 30, Prime members can score it for only $209.99 with the code FIRE43. That's 43% in savings and $20 cheaper than it was on Black Friday. A newer model recently replaced this one, but it'll cost you another $70.Roku TV Wireless Soundbar + Wireless Bass\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Roku\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Roku Wireless Soundbar and Wireless Bass\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $139.98\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $279.98\n                                                                             Save $140.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nRoku's wireless soundbar pairs seamlessly with Roku TVs without any cables to \"drastically improve the sound,\" as our friends at PCMag (also owned by Ziff Davis) put it. It's not overly packed with features and lacks spatial audio, but for the price, it's pretty solid. Plus, as of Dec. 30, it's bundled with the Roku Wireless Subwoofer for only $139.98. Together with the soundbar, the subwoofer can add depth and dimension to your music and movies. It's easy to setup and can slide into most spaces for an extra bass kick. Snag the set up at Amazon and save 50% for a limited time. That's the biggest discount on record.Blueair 311i+ Max air purifier\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Blueair\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Blueair 311i+ Max air purifier\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $179.99\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $299.99\n                                                                             Save $120.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nWinter should give you a break from allergies, but being holed up indoors can bring about air quality issues you didn't realize were a problem.

However, when former Mashable intern Stacia Datskovska tested it out, she found that even its many perks didn't justify it's outrageous $1,599.99 price tag. Fortunately, as of Dec. 30, its price has plummeted to only $899.99, making it a much more justifiable purchase. That 44% price drop brings it down to the budget-friendly range where its features beat the competition.None of these deals catching your eye? Check out Amazon's daily deals for even more savings."

For example, a 55-inch QLED for $399.99 is already quite digestible in itself &mdash; there's no way you would have seen a price point like that on a QLED five years ago.

    "sanitized": "SAVE UP TO $160: As of Dec. 30, Best Buy's Ring in the New Year Sale features a 50-inch, 55-inch, and 65-inch Hisense QLED TVs that are just about at Black Friday pricing — all at least 30% off and all below $350.If you didn't buy a TV on Black Friday, my next advice would typically be to wait until early February (the week of the big football game, specifically) to buy one — that's another one of the best times of year to buy a TV. That is, unless you happen to come across some deals that are basically still at their Black Friday pricing before it even hits the new year. That's the story with a few Hisense QLEDs during Best Buy's Ring in the New Year Sale, where a handful of sizes are as low as $10 away from what they were during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. If you're a football person, why not snag a new QLED now and bask in the brightness for all of the playoffs rather than just one game on Feb. 9?\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Hisense\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Hisense 55-inch QD5 QLED 4K TV\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $229.99\n                                                     at Best Buy\n                                                \n                                                                                            $399.99\n                                                                             Save $170.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nWhy we like itHisense's QD5 line is already really affordable in the realm of QLEDs when they're at full price. For example, a 55-inch QLED for $399.99 is already quite digestible in itself — there's no way you would have seen a price point like that on a QLED five years ago. Best Buy has then gone ahead and shaved over 40% off of that, putting this TV up for grabs for just $10 more than its $219.99 Black Friday price. If the idea of QLED was felt daunting in the past, this should change your mind.Compared to regular LED TVs, QLEDs put a layer of quantum dots on top of the traditional LED panel to pump out more vibrant colors that have the capacity to get much brighter than TVs without quantum dots.

Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder <a href=\"https://mashable.com/review/apple-watch-series-10\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">wrote in his review of the Series 10</a> that its probably not worth buying the new watch for Series 9 owners, but if \"you own any of the [other] previous versions, the Series 10 will feel a lot fresher...And if you've never owned an Apple Watch and want to dive in now, the Series 10 is a good place to start.\"</p><p>For instance, the 18-hour battery life from Apple Watches prior returns, but the latest iteration offers faster charging, promising zero to 80% in 30 minutes (Schroeder saw it go from 0 to 80% in 40 minutes, and 20 and 80% in 25). The display is one millimeter larger than past iterations, which Schroeder said made for a slightly more comfortable experience even if the display size didn't immediately feel bigger unless comparing the watches side by side. He did say, however, that the weight does drop nearly a third from the Series 9 to 10, and that difference was definitely noticeable.

As of Dec. 30, the prices break down so that the 42mm Apple Watch Series 10 is on sale for $329, down $70 from its $399 MSRP, and the 46mm Apple Watch Series 10 is $359, $70 down from the $429 MSRP. These are also the prices we saw these watches at during Black Friday season.\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            New iPhone 17 Pro rumor suggests changes are coming for the Dynamic Island\n            \n        \n    \nCompared to the Series 9, the Series 10 doesn't have any standout upgrades, but it makes several small improvements. Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder wrote in his review of the Series 10 that its probably not worth buying the new watch for Series 9 owners, but if \"you own any of the [other] previous versions, the Series 10 will feel a lot fresher...And if you've never owned an Apple Watch and want to dive in now, the Series 10 is a good place to start.\"For instance, the 18-hour battery life from Apple Watches prior returns, but the latest iteration offers faster charging, promising zero to 80% in 30 minutes (Schroeder saw it go from 0 to 80% in 40 minutes, and 20 and 80% in 25). The display is one millimeter larger than past iterations, which Schroeder said made for a slightly more comfortable experience even if the display size didn't immediately feel bigger unless comparing the watches side by side. He did say, however, that the weight does drop nearly a third from the Series 9 to 10, and that difference was definitely noticeable. The wide-angle OLED display also helped improve visibility from the side.\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Apple pulls iPhone SE and iPhone 14 from stores in the EU\n            \n        \n    \nBeyond battery and design, the watch comes packed with the same features as predecessors, along with a new depth app and water temperature sensor. The watch also supports audio playback, but we're betting more people will appreciate the better voice isolation for taking calls. And if you're wondering, no, this watch doesn't have the blood-oxygen sensor either due to a lawsuit against Apple.\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Apple\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS)\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $329.00\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $399.00\n                                                                             Save $70.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\n\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Apple\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS)\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $329.00\n                                                     at Walmart\n                                                \n                                                                                            $399.00\n                                                                             Save $70.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\n \n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Apple\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS)\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $329.00\n                                                     at Best Buy\n                                                \n                                                                                            $399.00\n                                                                             Save $70.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal"

It also comes with some smartwatch features like getting calls and texts on your Fitbit.This deal extends to all color options of the Fitbit Versa 4 available on Amazon so you can choose between Black, Pink Sand, or the Waterfall blue option. Each fitness tracker comes with small and large bands, so you can get the best fit possible.A major benefit of the Fitbit Versa 4 over a smartwatch like an Apple Watch is better battery life. While the Apple Watch gets about 18 hours of life before needing to recharge, the Fitbit Versa 4 can get over six days.Even if you haven't begun to think about 2025, grabbing the Fitbit Versa 4 fitness tracker for under $150 is a great move. Keeping tabs on sleep, activity levels, and stress management is a wise choice for every human."

You can try and do something rude or irreverent with the characters they depict, or if you want you can do something truly subversive: make them into something beautiful.</p><p>Below is a breakdown of everything you need to know about the freshly released creative works you can now treat as your own personal outline, canvas, inspiration, or collage material.&nbsp;</p><h2>What's Public Domain Day again?</h2><p>We&rsquo;re now entering the sixth year since a decades-long freeze on copyright finally thawed, and activists and copyright law experts &mdash; notably Jennifer Jenkins of Duke University &mdash; started trumpeting each Jan. 1 as a new de facto holiday called \"Public Domain Day.\" 2025 is no different, with notable public domain releases dropping on New Year&rsquo;s Day including still-electrifying books by Earnest Hemingway and William Faulkner, talkie films including at least one by Alfred Hitchcock, and the further unspooling of copyright protection on the bibliographies of Agatha Christie and Virginia Woolf.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold text-primary-400\">SEE ALSO:</span>\n        <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/mickey-mouse-steamboat-willie-public-domain-so-far\" class=\"flex items-center text-secondary-300\">\n            <span class=\"ml-1\">How people are using Mickey Mouse in his post-copyright era</span>\n            <svg class=\"ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current\"><use href=\"https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin\"></use></svg>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n<p>However, like last year when<em> Steamboat Willie</em>-era Mickey Mouse emerged from the public domain vault, some of the most significant pieces of freshly unshackled public domain art are the original appearances of two still-popular cartoon characters: Popeye and Tintin.</p><h2>What&rsquo;s the big idea with Popeye, spinach, and the public domain?</h2><p>Where Popeye is concerned, it&rsquo;s worth immediately drilling down on what this all means for creators who want to tell their own stories about the spinach-scarfing sailor. Long story short: they can do almost anything they want with him, and yes that includes having him eat spinach. &nbsp;</p><p>You may have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/26/nx-s1-5231543/copyright-public-domain-2025-cartoon-popeye-tintin-faulkner-hemingway\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">seen it reported elsewhere</a> that derivative works exploiting Popeye&rsquo;s new public domain status can&rsquo;t show him using spinach as a power-up. This would be massively disappointing since the spinach ex machina moment in every Popeye fight scene is a cornerstone of the character&rsquo;s iconography.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <a class=\"text-gray-600\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Srirachachau/status/1022369386487631874\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Popeye emerged about ten years into the long run of <em>Thimble Theatre,</em> a comic strip by E. C. Segar.&nbsp;In the 1929 installment \"Gobs of Work,\" the extant character Olive Oyl (who has already been in the public domain for years, for the record) encounters a scrunchy-faced tough guy in sailor garb named Popeye and asks if he is in fact a sailor. His surly rejoinder, \"'Ja think I&rsquo;m a&nbsp;<em>cowboy</em>?\" is succinct proof that Popeye&rsquo;s personality emerged fully fleshed-out. The trouble, however, is that in 1929 Popeye was never shown eating spinach. In fact, the character&nbsp;\"initially derived superhuman capabilities from rubbing the head feathers of <a href=\"https://popeye.fandom.com/wiki/Bernice\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Bernice the Whiffle&nbsp;Hen</a>,\" Jenkins, the Duke University copyright law expert told me. &nbsp;</p><p>In theory, this could seriously limit what creators can do with Popeye.

    "sanitized": "Jan. 1 is Public Domain Day, meaning artworks from 1929 (or 1924 in the case of sound recordings) are now free for all creators to use and abuse to their hearts' content. The works of art, music, literature, and film now entering the public domain will be yours, mine, and everyone's. You can try and do something rude or irreverent with the characters they depict, or if you want you can do something truly subversive: make them into something beautiful.Below is a breakdown of everything you need to know about the freshly released creative works you can now treat as your own personal outline, canvas, inspiration, or collage material. What's Public Domain Day again?We’re now entering the sixth year since a decades-long freeze on copyright finally thawed, and activists and copyright law experts — notably Jennifer Jenkins of Duke University — started trumpeting each Jan. 1 as a new de facto holiday called \"Public Domain Day.\" 2025 is no different, with notable public domain releases dropping on New Year’s Day including still-electrifying books by Earnest Hemingway and William Faulkner, talkie films including at least one by Alfred Hitchcock, and the further unspooling of copyright protection on the bibliographies of Agatha Christie and Virginia Woolf. \n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            How people are using Mickey Mouse in his post-copyright era\n            \n        \n    \nHowever, like last year when Steamboat Willie-era Mickey Mouse emerged from the public domain vault, some of the most significant pieces of freshly unshackled public domain art are the original appearances of two still-popular cartoon characters: Popeye and Tintin.What’s the big idea with Popeye, spinach, and the public domain?Where Popeye is concerned, it’s worth immediately drilling down on what this all means for creators who want to tell their own stories about the spinach-scarfing sailor. Long story short: they can do almost anything they want with him, and yes that includes having him eat spinach.  You may have seen it reported elsewhere that derivative works exploiting Popeye’s new public domain status can’t show him using spinach as a power-up. This would be massively disappointing since the spinach ex machina moment in every Popeye fight scene is a cornerstone of the character’s iconography. \n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n    \n\nPopeye emerged about ten years into the long run of Thimble Theatre, a comic strip by E. C. Segar. In the 1929 installment \"Gobs of Work,\" the extant character Olive Oyl (who has already been in the public domain for years, for the record) encounters a scrunchy-faced tough guy in sailor garb named Popeye and asks if he is in fact a sailor. His surly rejoinder, \"'Ja think I’m a cowboy?\" is succinct proof that Popeye’s personality emerged fully fleshed-out. The trouble, however, is that in 1929 Popeye was never shown eating spinach. In fact, the character \"initially derived superhuman capabilities from rubbing the head feathers of Bernice the Whiffle Hen,\" Jenkins, the Duke University copyright law expert told me.  In theory, this could seriously limit what creators can do with Popeye. Not only can’t he be depicted duking it out with Bluto — who doesn’t appear until 1932 — nor saving the life of his ward, Swee’Pea — not introduced until 1933 — but he has to be strong to the finish because he... massages an exotic bird? Would that even be Popeye content at all? Fortunately, Jenkins told me, there’s a pretty solid loophole that creators can exploit here: the copyright on a later strip from 1931 has lapsed early, and in that strip, Popeye announces in no uncertain terms that his superpowers derive from spinach:\n    \n                    \n\n\n            \n            \n            \n            Credit: public domain\n        \n    \nJenkins and her colleagues, she told me, pinpointed the above strip as the first reference to spinach in Thimble Theatre, and found that the copyright on that particular strip hasn’t been renewed, \"so this feature actually appears to be public domain.\" Jenkins and company searched for the strip in legal records for Popeye, Thimble Theatre, the distributor King Features Syndicate, and everything else that could tie up the strip’s copyright status, and its copyright truly appears to have vaporized entirely. The copyright-free status of that 1931 strip, however, doesn’t unlock the whole Popeye character until Public Domain Day. Essentially, Jenkins explained, \"Everything in the 1931 comic that derives from the original 1929 Popeye (such as the character) is still copyrighted until 2025, but new details that appeared only in that 1931 comic, such as spinach power, has long been public domain, so we can bring them together next year.\" That’s great news for creators who can now express themselves all they want through the Popeye character — or, more likely, churn the beloved cartoon character into a lazy and terrible slasher movie, as is their right.  Tintin in the Land of Public Domain\"Tintin enters the U.S. public domain in 2025 but is still copyrighted in the E.U. until 2054, because the author died in 1983,\" according to Jenkins' blog post about Public Domain Day 2025. It's a relatively rare case of U.S. public domain law being less stringent than the laws abroad. At any rate, Tintin started entirely as a work of anti-communist propaganda printed in a Belgian fascist newspaper called Le Vingtième Siècle. In the series of strips now entering the public domain, Tintin is employed as a plucky foreign correspondent for Le Vingtième Siècle deployed to Moscow, en route to which he is almost immediately attacked by a bomb-throwing Bolshevik terrorist, and then further accosted by censorious commies for being a bourgeois pig who threatens to blow the whistle on the reds and their evil exploits. However, Tintin is every bit his adventurous self, even in this early form, and his dog Snowy is along for the ride. If you want to spin your own Tintin yarns, with or without a hard right-wing slant, nothing should stop you from following your muse.

It can also be clipped on to whatever you need, thanks to its built-in carabiner. Attach it to a bag, belt loop, coat, or whatever else and carry your music with you. It comes in a wide variety of fun colors, too. And even with its small size, it offers up to 12 hours of playtime, plus waterproof and dustproof casing so you can take it wherever you want to go. If you need a lower profile speaker that won't take up too much space, this is your best bet. </p>",

It can also be clipped on to whatever you need, thanks to its built-in carabiner. Attach it to a bag, belt loop, coat, or whatever else and carry your music with you. It comes in a wide variety of fun colors, too. And even with its small size, it offers up to 12 hours of playtime, plus waterproof and dustproof casing so you can take it wherever you want to go. If you need a lower profile speaker that won't take up too much space, this is your best bet."

to start and end your days with smart features. It doesn't have a built-in camera, as that would be hella creepy, but it does show you the time, weather, song titles, and more at a glance. Control your smart devices with your voice, ask for the weather, set your favorite wake-up tune as your alarm, or ask it to lull you to sleep with white noise. It comes in three color options and is currently down to its previous record-low price of $44.99 as of Dec. 27. Even better, if you purchase two using the code SPOT2PACK, it'll only cost you $84.98 for two ($42.49 each) &mdash;&nbsp;a new all-time low.</p><h2>Amazon Echo Show 5</h2><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div class=\"mx-auto w-64 md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                                                        <a class=\"block group\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/QxXqdd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=image&element_label=image&object_type=article&object_uuid=00lmZ5jqqdyByXk8lkcaLOZ&short_url=QxXqdd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click>\n                                                                            <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00lmZ5jqqdyByXk8lkcaLOZ/images-8.fill.size_256x164.v1735310713.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Echo Show 5\" width=\"256\" height=\"164\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\n                        \n                        <div class=\"block relative mx-14 group-hover:visible tooltip\">\n                    <span class=\"absolute invisible p-1 mt-2 text-xs text-center text-white group-hover:visible tooltiptext bg-gray-600/0 group-hover:bg-gray-600/100\">\n                        Opens in a new window\n                    </span>\n                        </div>\n                                            </a>\n                                <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                            <span class=\"pr-5 mt-1 text-xs text-gray-600 subtitle-2\">Credit: Amazon</span>\n                                    </div>\n                        </div>\n    <div class=\"pl-0 mt-3 w-full md:pr-10 md:pl-7 md:mt-0 md:w-2/3\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QxXqdd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=title&element_label=Amazon%20Echo%20Show%205&object_type=article&object_uuid=00lmZ5jqqdyByXk8lkcaLOZ&short_url=QxXqdd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\" class=\"block mb-5 text-xl font-bold leading-8 text-center md:text-2xl md:text-left hover:underline text-secondary-300\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Amazon Echo Show 5\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    Amazon Echo Show 5\n                </a>\n                                        <div class=\"flex justify-between items-center py-0 md:space-x-2\">\n                <div class=\"md:w-2/3\" style=\"line-height: 0.75rem\">\n                                            <span class=\"text-sm font-bold\">$44.99</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"text-xs\"> at Amazon</span>\n                                                <br>\n                                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold line-through\">$89.99</span>\n                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold text-red-400\"> Save $45.00</span>\n                                                            </div>\n            </div>\n                                                    <a class=\"font-bold leading-6 text-center hover:underline\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/QxXqdd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=buy-button&element_label=Get%20Deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=00lmZ5jqqdyByXk8lkcaLOZ&short_url=QxXqdd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"Get Deal\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    <button class=\"inline-block px-5 mt-3 w-full font-sans text-base font-bold tracking-wide md:w-auto md:text-lg btn btn-secondary\">Get Deal</button>\n                </a>\n                        </div>\n</div>\n<p>The third-generation Echo Show 5, released last year, boasts an upgraded speaker system that packs double the bass of its predecessor, as well as more clarity for calls, music, audiobooks, podcasts, video content, and more.

It delivers more data points than you could ever hope for in a fitness tracker, including daily activity strain, heart rate, sleep quality, daily recovery score, alcohol and stress impacts, and more. It's screen-free, so it won't add any unnecessary distractions to your day. Our reviewer Sam Stone mentioned that parsing through all the data that Whoop offers was \"akin to taking the SAT,\" but he also adds that the Whoop 4.0 \"is a fitness band that is built to create a workout routine that will stick.\" We wish the membership didn't cost so much ($239 per year), but this discount on the band itself helps bring down the overall cost.

As of Dec. 27, however, that shock stings a little less with a 41% discount. At $705.95, it's down to its lowest price on record. While that still seems a bit steep, it's actually a really solid deal with a fully automatic espresso machine with a built-in milk frother. It features 18 one-touch and customizable recipes for espresso, lattes, cappuccinos, and more. Plus, there's a built-in conical burr grinder with 13 different settings.</p><h2>Apple AirTags (4-pack)</h2><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div class=\"mx-auto w-64 md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                                                        <a class=\"block group\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/zj4MYy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=image&element_label=image&object_type=article&object_uuid=00lmZ5jqqdyByXk8lkcaLOZ&short_url=zj4MYy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"5\" data-ga-click>\n                                                                            <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00lmZ5jqqdyByXk8lkcaLOZ/images-10.fill.size_256x139.v1735312313.jpg\" alt=\"four pack of AIrTags\" width=\"256\" height=\"139\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\n                        \n                        <div class=\"block relative mx-14 group-hover:visible tooltip\">\n                    <span class=\"absolute invisible p-1 mt-2 text-xs text-center text-white group-hover:visible tooltiptext bg-gray-600/0 group-hover:bg-gray-600/100\">\n                        Opens in a new window\n                    </span>\n                        </div>\n                                            </a>\n                                <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                            <span class=\"pr-5 mt-1 text-xs text-gray-600 subtitle-2\">Credit: Apple</span>\n                                    </div>\n                        </div>\n    <div class=\"pl-0 mt-3 w-full md:pr-10 md:pl-7 md:mt-0 md:w-2/3\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/zj4MYy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=title&element_label=Apple%20AirTags%20%284-pack%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00lmZ5jqqdyByXk8lkcaLOZ&short_url=zj4MYy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\" class=\"block mb-5 text-xl font-bold leading-8 text-center md:text-2xl md:text-left hover:underline text-secondary-300\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Apple AirTags (4-pack)\" data-ga-position=\"5\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    Apple AirTags (4-pack)\n                </a>\n                                        <div class=\"flex justify-between items-center py-0 md:space-x-2\">\n                <div class=\"md:w-2/3\" style=\"line-height: 0.75rem\">\n                                            <span class=\"text-sm font-bold\">$69.99</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"text-xs\"> at Amazon</span>\n                                                <br>\n                                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold line-through\">$99.00</span>\n                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold text-red-400\"> Save $29.01</span>\n                                                            </div>\n            </div>\n                                                    <a class=\"font-bold leading-6 text-center hover:underline\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/zj4MYy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=buy-button&element_label=Get%20Deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=00lmZ5jqqdyByXk8lkcaLOZ&short_url=zj4MYy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"Get Deal\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"5\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    <button class=\"inline-block px-5 mt-3 w-full font-sans text-base font-bold tracking-wide md:w-auto md:text-lg btn btn-secondary\">Get Deal</button>\n                </a>\n                        </div>\n</div>\n<p>We first saw this ultra-low price pop up during Black Friday, then again right before Christmas. We don't expect it will stick around much longer, so don't miss your chance to score a four-pack of Apple AirTags at its lowest price ever: $69.99. That's a savings of 29% and essentially gets you more than one and a half for free (reg. $29 a piece). These Bluetooth trackers are a must-have for iPhone users who are frequent flyers. As long as there's an Apple device nearby, you'll be able to keep track of whatever you attach your AirTag to &mdash; suitcase, keys, purse, guitar case, backpack, etc. You can see where you are in proximity to your stuff with an accuracy of only a few feet. </p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

It doesn't have a built-in camera, as that would be hella creepy, but it does show you the time, weather, song titles, and more at a glance. Control your smart devices with your voice, ask for the weather, set your favorite wake-up tune as your alarm, or ask it to lull you to sleep with white noise. It comes in three color options and is currently down to its previous record-low price of $44.99 as of Dec. 27. Even better, if you purchase two using the code SPOT2PACK, it'll only cost you $84.98 for two ($42.49 each) — a new all-time low.Amazon Echo Show 5\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Amazon\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Amazon Echo Show 5\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $44.99\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $89.99\n                                                                             Save $45.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nThe third-generation Echo Show 5, released last year, boasts an upgraded speaker system that packs double the bass of its predecessor, as well as more clarity for calls, music, audiobooks, podcasts, video content, and more. The reengineered microphone array makes for better Alexa responsiveness, while the Amazon AZ2 Neural Edge makes for a speedier overall experience. The display is still on the small side, at 5.5 inches, but that's what makes it a good fit for a nightstand or desktop. At $44.99 as of Dec. 27, it's just $5 away from its best price ever. That's 50% in savings.Whoop 4.0\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Whoop\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Whoop 4.0 fitness tracker\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $199.00\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $239.00\n                                                                             Save $40.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nThe Whoop 4.0 is one of our favorite fitness trackers on the market — particularly for sleep and recovery tracking. It delivers more data points than you could ever hope for in a fitness tracker, including daily activity strain, heart rate, sleep quality, daily recovery score, alcohol and stress impacts, and more. It's screen-free, so it won't add any unnecessary distractions to your day. Our reviewer Sam Stone mentioned that parsing through all the data that Whoop offers was \"akin to taking the SAT,\" but he also adds that the Whoop 4.0 \"is a fitness band that is built to create a workout routine that will stick.\" We wish the membership didn't cost so much ($239 per year), but this discount on the band itself helps bring down the overall cost.

As of Dec. 27, however, that shock stings a little less with a 41% discount. At $705.95, it's down to its lowest price on record. While that still seems a bit steep, it's actually a really solid deal with a fully automatic espresso machine with a built-in milk frother. It features 18 one-touch and customizable recipes for espresso, lattes, cappuccinos, and more. Plus, there's a built-in conical burr grinder with 13 different settings.Apple AirTags (4-pack)\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Apple\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Apple AirTags (4-pack)\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $69.99\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $99.00\n                                                                             Save $29.01\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nWe first saw this ultra-low price pop up during Black Friday, then again right before Christmas. We don't expect it will stick around much longer, so don't miss your chance to score a four-pack of Apple AirTags at its lowest price ever: $69.99. That's a savings of 29% and essentially gets you more than one and a half for free (reg. $29 a piece). These Bluetooth trackers are a must-have for iPhone users who are frequent flyers. As long as there's an Apple device nearby, you'll be able to keep track of whatever you attach your AirTag to — suitcase, keys, purse, guitar case, backpack, etc. You can see where you are in proximity to your stuff with an accuracy of only a few feet.

The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXk7VH_2g9Y\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">future is now, old man,</a> and it's sleek, electric, and oozing with tech.</p><p>CES&rsquo;s knack for blending cutting-edge tech with high-octane theatrics has always made it compelling. Over the past few years, that magic has increasingly centered around the auto industry. At last year&rsquo;s event, we got a peek at the Sony-Honda AFEELA car, interesting<a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/ambarella-self-driving-car-hands-on\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"> developments in autonomous driving</a>, and even the <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/ces-flying-car-xpeng-aeroht\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">promise of airborne cars</a> straight out of sci-fi.</p><p>The 2025 edition is set to keep that momentum revving. From January 7 to 10, CES will take over Las Vegas. Here&rsquo;s what to watch for if you&rsquo;re an EV enthusiast, a self-driving hopeful, or just someone who dreams of a flying commute.</p><h2>1. New EVs from the major players</h2><p>As noted, the Sony-Honda collaboration EV, AFEELA, made its debut at CES 2024. This year, the tech titans are stepping it up, allowing attendees to demo the car&rsquo;s cutting-edge features and onboard tech. The project is now under the purview of the Sony Honda Mobility Group, which plans to unveil pre-order details and other updates during a keynote on January 7.</p><p>Meanwhile, Honda will be showcasing two prototypes from its <a href=\"https://0.honda/en/topics/20241219/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">upcoming 0 Series EV lineup</a>. These vehicles are slated to feature Honda&rsquo;s proprietary operating system paired with \"autonomous driving technology.\"</p><h2>2. More autonomous driving and SDVs</h2><p>When it comes to autonomous driving, the CES hype machine is in full gear, with startups flooding inboxes to tout their latest innovations. While companies like <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/ambarella-self-driving-car-hands-on\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Ambarella showcase some impressive tech</a>, it&rsquo;s clear that for many, the dream of street-ready autonomy remains just that &mdash; a dream.</p><p>Still, that hasn&rsquo;t stopped a wave of companies from leveraging CES to highlight the industrial potential of automated vehicles. Applied EV, for instance, plans to unveil autonomous solutions designed for niche sectors like mining, transportation, and specialized logistics. Meanwhile, the robo-trucking segment is gearing up to make its presence known, offering awe-inspiring displays of innovation that also raise tough questions about the future of work.</p><p>Tying it all together is one of CES&rsquo;s most significant trends: <strong>Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs).</strong> These are cars where software takes precedence over hardware, redefining not just how vehicles operate but how they&rsquo;re built. Honda&rsquo;s 0 Series, for example, epitomizes this shift, and startups are lining up to showcase how software-centric design could revolutionize mobility as we know it.</p><h2>3. Infrastructure</h2><p>The future of mobility may be electric, but turning that vision into reality hinges on building the right infrastructure. That&rsquo;s why CES 2025 will be brimming with startups flaunting their EV charging innovations, aiming to fill the gaps left <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/11/teslas-profitable-supercharger-network-in-limbo-after-musk-axed-entire-team/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">as the Tesla Supercharger network remains in limbo</a>. The goal for now is a more accessible, widespread charging infrastructure nationwide.</p><p>Take EVgo, for instance, a startup making waves after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/evgo-secures-1-25-billion-loan-amid-bidens-rush-to-approve-clean-energy-loans/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">securing a $1.25 billion loan</a> from the U.S. Department of Energy under the Biden Administration to supercharge public EV charging infrastructure. However, with Trump set to take office in 2025, the trajectory of EV adoption and support remains uncertain (<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-transition-team-plans-sweeping-rollback-biden-ev-emissions-policies-2024-12-16/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">or worse, in danger</a>). For now, CES provides a critical stage for startups to showcase their technology to investors.</p><h2>4. AI</h2><p>You knew it was coming: cars are getting AI. Love it or loathe it, artificial intelligence is no longer a hypothetical feature &mdash;it&rsquo;s the future of driving. At CES 2025, AI will be front and center, with major manufacturers and ambitious startups ready to show off their latest innovations.</p><p>One of the standout panels in this regard is \"<a href=\"https://www.ces.tech/schedule/revolutionizing-the-future-of-driving-unleashing-the-power-of-ai-sponsored-by-arm/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">Revolutionizing the Future of Driving: Unleashing the Power of AI</a>,\" featuring execs from Honda, BMW, and Rivian. They&rsquo;ll delve into how AI is reshaping the driving experience, promising everything from smarter in-car assistants to fully reimagined user interfaces.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve already seen glimpses of this with Mercedes-Benz, <a href=\"https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-b35d2af89e06f556bbd8fe420412e9c2-mercedes-benz-takes-in-car-voice-control-to-a-new-level-with-chatgpt\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">which integrated ChatGPT</a> to power a conversational virtual assistant in its vehicles. At CES, expect the buzz to be around &ldquo;agentic AI&rdquo;&mdash;intelligent systems designed to replace traditional dashboard UI/UX with something more adaptive, predictive, and intuitive.</p><p>And if that&rsquo;s not enough to excite, Hyundai plans to showcase its futuristic holographic windshield display tech, offering a tantalizing peek at what&rsquo;s next for augmented reality on the road.

    "sanitized": "CES is the nation’s flagship tech extravaganza and while it's still a gadget geek’s paradise, it's also become a sprawling automotive playground. The future is now, old man, and it's sleek, electric, and oozing with tech.CES’s knack for blending cutting-edge tech with high-octane theatrics has always made it compelling. Over the past few years, that magic has increasingly centered around the auto industry. At last year’s event, we got a peek at the Sony-Honda AFEELA car, interesting developments in autonomous driving, and even the promise of airborne cars straight out of sci-fi.The 2025 edition is set to keep that momentum revving. From January 7 to 10, CES will take over Las Vegas. Here’s what to watch for if you’re an EV enthusiast, a self-driving hopeful, or just someone who dreams of a flying commute.1. New EVs from the major playersAs noted, the Sony-Honda collaboration EV, AFEELA, made its debut at CES 2024. This year, the tech titans are stepping it up, allowing attendees to demo the car’s cutting-edge features and onboard tech. The project is now under the purview of the Sony Honda Mobility Group, which plans to unveil pre-order details and other updates during a keynote on January 7.Meanwhile, Honda will be showcasing two prototypes from its upcoming 0 Series EV lineup. These vehicles are slated to feature Honda’s proprietary operating system paired with \"autonomous driving technology.\"2. More autonomous driving and SDVsWhen it comes to autonomous driving, the CES hype machine is in full gear, with startups flooding inboxes to tout their latest innovations. While companies like Ambarella showcase some impressive tech, it’s clear that for many, the dream of street-ready autonomy remains just that — a dream.Still, that hasn’t stopped a wave of companies from leveraging CES to highlight the industrial potential of automated vehicles. Applied EV, for instance, plans to unveil autonomous solutions designed for niche sectors like mining, transportation, and specialized logistics. Meanwhile, the robo-trucking segment is gearing up to make its presence known, offering awe-inspiring displays of innovation that also raise tough questions about the future of work.Tying it all together is one of CES’s most significant trends: Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs). These are cars where software takes precedence over hardware, redefining not just how vehicles operate but how they’re built. Honda’s 0 Series, for example, epitomizes this shift, and startups are lining up to showcase how software-centric design could revolutionize mobility as we know it.3. InfrastructureThe future of mobility may be electric, but turning that vision into reality hinges on building the right infrastructure. That’s why CES 2025 will be brimming with startups flaunting their EV charging innovations, aiming to fill the gaps left as the Tesla Supercharger network remains in limbo. The goal for now is a more accessible, widespread charging infrastructure nationwide.Take EVgo, for instance, a startup making waves after securing a $1.25 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy under the Biden Administration to supercharge public EV charging infrastructure. However, with Trump set to take office in 2025, the trajectory of EV adoption and support remains uncertain (or worse, in danger). For now, CES provides a critical stage for startups to showcase their technology to investors.4. AIYou knew it was coming: cars are getting AI. Love it or loathe it, artificial intelligence is no longer a hypothetical feature —it’s the future of driving. At CES 2025, AI will be front and center, with major manufacturers and ambitious startups ready to show off their latest innovations.One of the standout panels in this regard is \"Revolutionizing the Future of Driving: Unleashing the Power of AI,\" featuring execs from Honda, BMW, and Rivian. They’ll delve into how AI is reshaping the driving experience, promising everything from smarter in-car assistants to fully reimagined user interfaces.We’ve already seen glimpses of this with Mercedes-Benz, which integrated ChatGPT to power a conversational virtual assistant in its vehicles. At CES, expect the buzz to be around “agentic AI”—intelligent systems designed to replace traditional dashboard UI/UX with something more adaptive, predictive, and intuitive.And if that’s not enough to excite, Hyundai plans to showcase its futuristic holographic windshield display tech, offering a tantalizing peek at what’s next for augmented reality on the road. In short: buckle up for an AI-powered ride.5. Modularity At CES, car manufacturers are reimagining vehicles as more than just a means to get from point A to point B. This shift was evident at CES 2024 with Kia’s PBV series — wildly modular cars designed to adapt to a variety of roles. Expect that vision to expand at CES 2025, with the standout being XPENG AEROHT’s modular flying car, a concept straight out of a sci-fi blockbuster.The challenge for this futuristic sector will be proving necessity. While modular vehicles are undeniably cool, the hefty price tags demand practical use cases to justify the investment. Kia’s strategy last year highlighted this reality, positioning its modular EVs as solutions for business owners, industrial applications, and gig economy workers."

S9. It features the same tough IP68 dust- and water-resistant rating as the S9, a slightly smaller battery capacity (8,000 vs. 8,400 mAh), and the same included S Pen. The battery will last you up to 18 hours on one charge and the Samsung Exynos 1380 processor&nbsp;can help you power through plenty of tasks &mdash; even some light gaming. The biggest differences between the S9 and S9 FE are the display and CPU, which likely won't make too much of a difference unless you're a hardcore tablet user. As of Dec. 24, the 128GB, WiFi version is on sale for just $280.09 instead of $449.99. That's 38% in savings and its lowest price on record.</p><h2>Sony WH-CH720N noise-cancelling headphones</h2><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div class=\"mx-auto w-64 md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                                                        <a class=\"block group\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/QKOl18?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=image&element_label=image&object_type=article&object_uuid=02d9gFcLnGJT2w7eV2JdyGw&short_url=QKOl18&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click>\n                                                                            <img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02d9gFcLnGJT2w7eV2JdyGw/images-7.fill.size_189x256.v1735052135.jpg\" alt=\"Sony noise-cancelling headphones\" width=\"189\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\n                        \n                        <div class=\"block relative mx-14 group-hover:visible tooltip\">\n                    <span class=\"absolute invisible p-1 mt-2 text-xs text-center text-white group-hover:visible tooltiptext bg-gray-600/0 group-hover:bg-gray-600/100\">\n                        Opens in a new window\n                    </span>\n                        </div>\n                                            </a>\n                                <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                            <span class=\"pr-5 mt-1 text-xs text-gray-600 subtitle-2\">Credit: Sony</span>\n                                    </div>\n                        </div>\n    <div class=\"pl-0 mt-3 w-full md:pr-10 md:pl-7 md:mt-0 md:w-2/3\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QKOl18?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=title&element_label=Sony%20WH-CH720N%20noise-cancelling%20headphones&object_type=article&object_uuid=02d9gFcLnGJT2w7eV2JdyGw&short_url=QKOl18&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\" class=\"block mb-5 text-xl font-bold leading-8 text-center md:text-2xl md:text-left hover:underline text-secondary-300\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Sony WH-CH720N noise-cancelling headphones\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    Sony WH-CH720N noise-cancelling headphones\n                </a>\n                                        <div class=\"flex justify-between items-center py-0 md:space-x-2\">\n                <div class=\"md:w-2/3\" style=\"line-height: 0.75rem\">\n                                            <span class=\"text-sm font-bold\">$74.99</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"text-xs\"> at Amazon</span>\n                                                <br>\n                                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold line-through\">$149.99</span>\n                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold text-red-400\"> Save $75.00</span>\n                                                            </div>\n            </div>\n                                                    <a class=\"font-bold leading-6 text-center hover:underline\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/QKOl18?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=buy-button&element_label=Get%20Deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=02d9gFcLnGJT2w7eV2JdyGw&short_url=QKOl18&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"Get Deal\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    <button class=\"inline-block px-5 mt-3 w-full font-sans text-base font-bold tracking-wide md:w-auto md:text-lg btn btn-secondary\">Get Deal</button>\n                </a>\n                        </div>\n</div>\n<p>A direct replacement for the Sony WH-CH710N headphones, which our friends at <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/sony-wh-ch710n\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">PCMag</a> (also owned by Ziff Davis) said \"offer solid audio performance and active noise cancellation,\" the WH-C720N are down to just $74.99 at Amazon as of Dec. 24.

They may not be the fanciest headphones in Sony's lineup, but they're stylish, reliable, and most importantly, affordable.</p><h2>Shark FlexStyle</h2><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div class=\"mx-auto w-64 md:mx-0 md:w-1/3\">\n                                                        <a class=\"block group\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/Q41vLm?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=image&element_label=image&object_type=article&object_uuid=02d9gFcLnGJT2w7eV2JdyGw&short_url=Q41vLm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\"title=\"(opens in a new window)\" data-ga-action=\"product_image\" data-ga-label=\"image\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"3\" data-ga-click>\n                                                                            <img class=\"w-full\" src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02d9gFcLnGJT2w7eV2JdyGw/images-6.fill.size_256x217.v1735052135.jpg\" alt=\"Shark FlexStyle with attachments\" width=\"256\" height=\"217\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\n                        \n                        <div class=\"block relative mx-14 group-hover:visible tooltip\">\n                    <span class=\"absolute invisible p-1 mt-2 text-xs text-center text-white group-hover:visible tooltiptext bg-gray-600/0 group-hover:bg-gray-600/100\">\n                        Opens in a new window\n                    </span>\n                        </div>\n                                            </a>\n                                <div class=\"mt-2 leading-none text-left\">\n                                            <span class=\"pr-5 mt-1 text-xs text-gray-600 subtitle-2\">Credit: Shark</span>\n                                    </div>\n                        </div>\n    <div class=\"pl-0 mt-3 w-full md:pr-10 md:pl-7 md:mt-0 md:w-2/3\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Q41vLm?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=title&element_label=Shark%20FlexStyle&object_type=article&object_uuid=02d9gFcLnGJT2w7eV2JdyGw&short_url=Q41vLm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\"target=\"_blank\" class=\"block mb-5 text-xl font-bold leading-8 text-center md:text-2xl md:text-left hover:underline text-secondary-300\" data-ga-action=\"offer-title\" data-ga-item=\"title\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Shark FlexStyle\" data-ga-position=\"3\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    Shark FlexStyle\n                </a>\n                                        <div class=\"flex justify-between items-center py-0 md:space-x-2\">\n                <div class=\"md:w-2/3\" style=\"line-height: 0.75rem\">\n                                            <span class=\"text-sm font-bold\">$249.99</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"text-xs\"> at Amazon</span>\n                                                <br>\n                                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold line-through\">$319.99</span>\n                                                                            <span class=\"text-xs font-bold text-red-400\"> Save $70.00</span>\n                                                            </div>\n            </div>\n                                                    <a class=\"font-bold leading-6 text-center hover:underline\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/Q41vLm?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=buy-button&element_label=Get%20Deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=02d9gFcLnGJT2w7eV2JdyGw&short_url=Q41vLm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-action=\"buy-link\" data-ga-item=\"buy-button\" data-ga-label=\"Get Deal\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-module=\"shop-card\" data-ga-position=\"3\" data-ga-click title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\n                    <button class=\"inline-block px-5 mt-3 w-full font-sans text-base font-bold tracking-wide md:w-auto md:text-lg btn btn-secondary\">Get Deal</button>\n                </a>\n                        </div>\n</div>\n<p>The Shark FlexStyle remains <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dyson-airwrap-dupes\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">our favorite Dyson Airwrap dupe</a>.

It features the same tough IP68 dust- and water-resistant rating as the S9, a slightly smaller battery capacity (8,000 vs. 8,400 mAh), and the same included S Pen. The battery will last you up to 18 hours on one charge and the Samsung Exynos 1380 processor can help you power through plenty of tasks — even some light gaming. The biggest differences between the S9 and S9 FE are the display and CPU, which likely won't make too much of a difference unless you're a hardcore tablet user. As of Dec. 24, the 128GB, WiFi version is on sale for just $280.09 instead of $449.99.

That's 50% in savings and the best price we've ever seen them. The new design is inspired by the fancier and more expensive WH-1000XM5s (which we're huge fans of). Compared to their predecessor, they've upgraded the sound and noise-cancellation, boosting sensitivity in the drivers and increasing the dynamic range, while keeping the same impressive 35-hour battery life with ANC. They may not be the fanciest headphones in Sony's lineup, but they're stylish, reliable, and most importantly, affordable.Shark FlexStyle\n    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                        Opens in a new window\n                    \n                        \n                                            \n                                \n                                            Credit: Shark\n                                    \n                        \n    \n                                    \n                    Shark FlexStyle\n                \n                                        \n                \n                                            $249.99\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n                                                                                            $319.99\n                                                                             Save $70.00\n                                                            \n            \n                                                    \n                    Get Deal\n                \n                        \n\nThe Shark FlexStyle remains our favorite Dyson Airwrap dupe. In fact, we actually prefer it over Dyson's outrageously expensive hot air multistyler. This deal includes six attachments for all hair types, including the paddle brush, curl-defining diffuser, auto-wrap curlers, concentrator, and oval brush. If you're looking for the best damage-free drying and styling system on the market, the FlexStyle is the way to go — especially while it's on sale for $249.99 instead of $319.99.

And if you're on a budget, it's even better. The 40-inch model is on sale for just $149.99 as of Dec. 24, which is 40% off its usual cost and matches its lowest price on record. It may not support 4K resolution (check out the 4-Series or Omni Series for that feature), but it does offer all the smart capabilities from the Fire TV experience, hands-free control through on on-board Alexa, and support for HDR 10, HLG, and Dolby Digital Audio.None of these deals catching your eye?
