    "raw": "\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">When cables are cut, sanctions are put in place or privacy legislation prohibits the use of the service your entire organization depends on, what can you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amidst geo-political changes, organizations face dependencies on large, centralized communication platforms. A major example of this is the SaaS-only communication platform Microsoft Teams. It is the only solution on the market which deeply integrates video calls, team chat and large group call features with real-time document collaboration and file sharing, and has become critical to the functioning of many organizations. Which, in turn, has allowed Microsoft to hike prices by 20 to 40% and not face an exodus of customers – as they and their data are fully locked in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations, small and large, need a way to ensure the resiliency and digital sovereignty of their operations – an open source, privacy respecting alternative to Teams. And today, we present that solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Introducing the Open Source answer to Microsoft Teams\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1035504262?h=776fa1186e&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In this short webinar, Jos walks you through how Nextcloud Talk takes on Microsoft Teams!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-top\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 22%\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Welcome to Nextcloud Talk</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, live from our Enterprise day in Paris, we launch Nextcloud Talk „Paris“. It is the <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/talk/#compare\">only open-source solution that integrates all key features</a> – from chats and video conferencing to webinars, complete with file sharing and office document editing – into a single platform while avoiding vendor lock-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our platform meets the highest standards of compliance with privacy legislations like GDPR or HIPAA and offers strict data security, ensuring full data control. Thanks to its open architecture, Talk can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems and tailored to individual needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nextcloud Talk is designed to address three key use cases. Let’s go quickly over them!</p>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\" src=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/12/Nextcloud-Talk-1.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-273429 size-full\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Efficient team chat</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The integrated chat in Nextcloud Talk is designed to help teams stay connected throughout the workday. With multiple chat rooms and the ability to edit files directly within the chat, Talk streamlines hybrid team collaboration and boosts efficiency. End-to-end encryption ensures that calls remain private and secure, while integrated real-time notifications keep everyone in the loop. All data stays under your control, meeting the highest privacy and security standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It features deep integration with a wide variety of content. Users can add documents &#8211; and edit them right there, inline, without having to open tabs or download the file. Locations, tasks, calendars and notes can all be inserted, viewed and edited without leaving Talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:29px\" aria-hidden=\"true\"

The platform supports live streaming, Q&amp;A sessions and screensharing and comes with moderation features. Functions like the integrated chat, animated reactions, polls and breakout rooms make the learning experience more interactive and fun. All this, and more, is available wherever you are. Not only in the browser, but also with apps on iOS and Android! When your colleague calls you while you’re out, your phone will ring and you’ll be able to share your screen to show them a quick presentation you’re working on.</p>\n\n\n<section class=\"simple-slider-section \" id=\"\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n                    <div class=\"owl-carousel simple_slider_slideshow\" id=\"\">\n                                    <div class=\"gallery_item\" id=\"271774\">\n                        <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy.jpg\" class=\"simple_slider_slideshow_link\">\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy.jpg 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" />                        </a>\n                                            </div>\n                                    <div class=\"gallery_item\" id=\"271754\">\n                        <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy.jpg\" class=\"simple_slider_slideshow_link\">\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy.jpg 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" />                        </a>\n                                            </div>\n                                    <div class=\"gallery_item\" id=\"271759\">\n                        <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy.jpg\" class=\"simple_slider_slideshow_link\">\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy.jpg 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" />                        </a>\n                                            </div>\n                            </ul>\n        \t</div>\n</section>\n<script type=\"rocketlazyloadscript\">\n    jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {\n        var owl_simple_slider = $('.simple_slider_slideshow');\n        owl_simple_slider.owlCarousel({\n            loop:true,\n            stagePadding: 50,\n            autoplay: true,\n            margin:10,\n            dots: false,\n            nav:true,\n            responsive:{\n                0:{\n                    items:1\n                },\n                600:{\n                    items:1\n                },\n                800:{\n                    items:1\n                },\n                1000:{\n                    items:1\n                }\n            },\n            onDragged: owl_stop_autoplay,\n            autoplayHoverPause:true\n        });\n\n        owl_simple_slider.on('click', function(e) {\n            owl_stop_autoplay();\n        });\n        function owl_stop_autoplay() {\n            //console.log('autoplay stopped.');\n            owl_simple_slider.trigger('stop.owl.autoplay');\n        }\n\n    });\n</script>\n\n\n\n<p>You can give participants a phone number to dial in to, and even pull them in by dialing out right from Talk.

You can send silent chat messages and even start silent calls which don&#8217;t send notifications to everyone. User status communicates to colleagues if you&#8217;re available or not &#8211; the status will automatically change when you are in a call or have an appointment in your calendar, and your time zone is visible for others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need to deal with something &#8211; but not right now? You can mark a chat as unread, but also set a reminder on an individual message. You&#8217;ll get a notification at the time you set! You can also send a message to a special &#8216;Note to self&#8217; chat, or put notes there by hand. Keep things organized for yourself. Perhaps favorite your Note to self chat so it&#8217;s always on top with other important chats?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also set your work hours and enable do-not-disturb outside those hours. Calls give a warning at the 1h mark and can now automatically end after a set time. And, during calls, you can see how much each participant talked so you can make sure even the quiet team members get to have their say.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">High-security communication</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nextcloud Talk meets the highest security standards and can even be deployed in airgap environments, keeping all communication strictly away from the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>Discover more new features</summary>\n<p>Calls:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Summarize Call recordings automatically with AI</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enforce a maximum call lenght</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option to always disable devices by default</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option to download a call participants list</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option to blur background by default</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Chat:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Summary of chat histories when there are many unread messages</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option to directly download attachments</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Highlight file and object shares with an icon in conversations list</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Guests:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Identify and recognize guests invited via mail address</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allow inviting email guests when creating a conversation</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Option to archive conversations</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Automatically lock rooms after days of inactivity</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Voice Messages:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Auto play voice messages which are grouped together</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Polls:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Draft, import and export polls</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:29px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A glimpse into the future of collaboration</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With Nextcloud Talk, we empower companies and public institutions to work securely and productively – regardless of their location or infrastructure.

    "sanitized": "When cables are cut, sanctions are put in place or privacy legislation prohibits the use of the service your entire organization depends on, what can you do?\n\n\n\nAmidst geo-political changes, organizations face dependencies on large, centralized communication platforms. A major example of this is the SaaS-only communication platform Microsoft Teams. It is the only solution on the market which deeply integrates video calls, team chat and large group call features with real-time document collaboration and file sharing, and has become critical to the functioning of many organizations. Which, in turn, has allowed Microsoft to hike prices by 20 to 40% and not face an exodus of customers – as they and their data are fully locked in.\n\n\n\nOrganisations, small and large, need a way to ensure the resiliency and digital sovereignty of their operations – an open source, privacy respecting alternative to Teams. And today, we present that solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this short webinar, Jos walks you through how Nextcloud Talk takes on Microsoft Teams!\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Nextcloud Talk\n\n\n\nToday, live from our Enterprise day in Paris, we launch Nextcloud Talk „Paris“. It is the only open-source solution that integrates all key features – from chats and video conferencing to webinars, complete with file sharing and office document editing – into a single platform while avoiding vendor lock-in.\n\n\n\nOur platform meets the highest standards of compliance with privacy legislations like GDPR or HIPAA and offers strict data security, ensuring full data control. Thanks to its open architecture, Talk can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems and tailored to individual needs.\n\n\n\nNextcloud Talk is designed to address three key use cases. Let’s go quickly over them!\n\n\n\n\nEfficient team chat\n\n\n\nThe integrated chat in Nextcloud Talk is designed to help teams stay connected throughout the workday. With multiple chat rooms and the ability to edit files directly within the chat, Talk streamlines hybrid team collaboration and boosts efficiency. End-to-end encryption ensures that calls remain private and secure, while integrated real-time notifications keep everyone in the loop. All data stays under your control, meeting the highest privacy and security standards.\n\n\n\nIt features deep integration with a wide variety of content. Users can add documents – and edit them right there, inline, without having to open tabs or download the file. Locations, tasks, calendars and notes can all be inserted, viewed and edited without leaving Talk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n                    \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                            \n        \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo calls for seamless collaboration\n\n\n\nNextcloud Talk makes virtual meetings easy and accessible across devices. Whether it’s a quick check-in or a larger team meeting, our platform ensures powerful collaboration for hybrid working teams. Features like integrated whiteboards, screen sharing, and joint document editing make real-time collaboration easier than ever. Scheduling and joining calls is effortless, directly from the Nextcloud interface, integrated with the calendar app for easy scheduling of meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n                    \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                            \n        \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive webinars, education and training sessions\n\n\n\nTalk enables you to host engaging webinars – bringing audiences like teams, students, or customers together. The platform supports live streaming, Q&A sessions and screensharing and comes with moderation features. Functions like the integrated chat, animated reactions, polls and breakout rooms make the learning experience more interactive and fun. All this, and more, is available wherever you are. Not only in the browser, but also with apps on iOS and Android! When your colleague calls you while you’re out, your phone will ring and you’ll be able to share your screen to show them a quick presentation you’re working on.\n\n\n\n\t\n                    \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                            \n        \t\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can give participants a phone number to dial in to, and even pull them in by dialing out right from Talk. Need to add hundreds, even thousands of participants? Simply import a spreadsheet. After the call, you export the participant list and see who did and did not show up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak up big groups in breakout rooms, enabling everyone to be productive in a smaller team before coming back together to the big group. In your breakout room you can do a call, chat, work on a whiteboard, share documents and more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerous new features for better collaboration\n\n\n\nNew desktop app\n\n\n\nNo more searching through browser tabs! The new app offers desktop integration and notifications, allowing users to communicate and join calls effortlessly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew AI features\n\n\n\nTired of taking notes in long meetings? Enjoy our automatically generated summaries of video meetings! Dreading those 173 unread messages in the morning? The Nextcloud Assistant summarizes them for you. Less work, less stress!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual collaboration\n\n\n\nThe interactive whiteboard enables teams to brainstorm and develop ideas in real-time – ideal for workshops and project planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan your polls\n\n\n\nYou can now save a poll as a draft, for quick publishing when the class has started. Need to use the same poll in a different class? Simply export it as a file and import it in the new room. At the end, export the poll as image or spreadsheet. Easy as pie!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplified teamwork\n\n\n\nDocuments can be collaboratively edited directly within chats or video calls. No need to switch to another window or tab! You can easily find chat messages with the search, leave and join open chat rooms or archive the ones you no longer follow, so you stay as connected as you need to be.\n\n\n\nLet colleagues know what you think with reactions to chat messages, or animated reactions during calls. And if you need to make a point, you can use bold, italics, headers and even tables in your messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMindfulness features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo promote a healthy meeting culture, Nextcloud Talk has a series of small features that help you be mindful of yourself and others.

An alternative is open-source AI models which, much like open-source software, have a potential to give you more transparency and control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can study and even modify the model you are using, and if you don&#8217;t need that — at least understand how your data is processed, stored and shared. Sounds like something the viral AI photo editing apps can’t promise, yet millions keep giving them access to their private photos every day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join us as we explore how open-source AI benefits users and, from the perspective of our Ethical AI rating, provide examples of AI models that can help you reclaim your privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are open-source AI models?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With more people becoming aware of how data economy works, earning user’s trust becomes more challenging to the AI providers. To appeal to more conscious users, many AI vendors label their technology open or open-source. But without consensus on what open-source AI is, such open-washing could raise many risks: surveillance, information bias, effects on the labor market and creative industries, and excessive energy usage — to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In attempt to battle the potentially harmful trend, the Open Source Initiative released its official <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/blog/open-source-ai-is-here/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Open Source Artificial Intelligence Definition (OSAID)</a>. According to the OSAID, an Open Source AI is an AI system made available under terms and in a way that grant the freedoms&nbsp;to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list nc-list\">\n<li>Use&nbsp;the system for any purpose and without having to ask for permission.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Study&nbsp;how the system works and inspect its components.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Modify&nbsp;the system for any purpose, including to change its output.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share&nbsp;the system for others to use with or without modifications, for any purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the work on this definition has been endorsed by many companies and individuals, there&#8217;s no consensus in the community on whether or not to accept it in its current state, or if the open-source AI is even ready to be defined. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We too think there&#8217;s room for improvement. But with or without concrete definition for the OS AI, we can tell how four main freedoms of open-source &#8211; to use, to study, to modify, and to share &#8211; can impact life of the the AI users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do users benefit from open-source AI?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source promotes freedom and empowers users to control their software &#8211; in this case, the AI &#8211; they rely on. Here are several examples of opens-source AI systems could directly benefit you as a user:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list nc-list\">\n<li>Proprietary AI can include hidden features like data harvesting for advertising and user profiling, embedded biases, and using your private data to refine the products without your consent. Open-source lets you make sure there are no hidden features or data backdoors &#8211; because you (and thousands, or even millions of others) can inspect the source code and understand how the software operates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If your software is not anymore supported by a provider, you may lose valuable data like your AI’s memory of interactions.

    "sanitized": "AI tools woven into the big tech ecosystems, some more “open” than others, some more quiet, often require a silent sacrifice in exchange for easy-to-access technology. An alternative is open-source AI models which, much like open-source software, have a potential to give you more transparency and control.\n\n\n\nYou can study and even modify the model you are using, and if you don’t need that — at least understand how your data is processed, stored and shared. Sounds like something the viral AI photo editing apps can’t promise, yet millions keep giving them access to their private photos every day. \n\n\n\nJoin us as we explore how open-source AI benefits users and, from the perspective of our Ethical AI rating, provide examples of AI models that can help you reclaim your privacy.\n\n\n\nWhat are open-source AI models?\n\n\n\nWith more people becoming aware of how data economy works, earning user’s trust becomes more challenging to the AI providers. To appeal to more conscious users, many AI vendors label their technology open or open-source. But without consensus on what open-source AI is, such open-washing could raise many risks: surveillance, information bias, effects on the labor market and creative industries, and excessive energy usage — to name a few.\n\n\n\nIn attempt to battle the potentially harmful trend, the Open Source Initiative released its official Open Source Artificial Intelligence Definition (OSAID). According to the OSAID, an Open Source AI is an AI system made available under terms and in a way that grant the freedoms to:\n\n\n\n\nUse the system for any purpose and without having to ask for permission.\n\n\n\nStudy how the system works and inspect its components.\n\n\n\nModify the system for any purpose, including to change its output.\n\n\n\nShare the system for others to use with or without modifications, for any purpose.\n\n\n\n\nEven though the work on this definition has been endorsed by many companies and individuals, there’s no consensus in the community on whether or not to accept it in its current state, or if the open-source AI is even ready to be defined. \n\n\n\nWe too think there’s room for improvement. But with or without concrete definition for the OS AI, we can tell how four main freedoms of open-source – to use, to study, to modify, and to share – can impact life of the the AI users.\n\n\n\nHow do users benefit from open-source AI?\n\n\n\nOpen source promotes freedom and empowers users to control their software – in this case, the AI – they rely on. Here are several examples of opens-source AI systems could directly benefit you as a user:\n\n\n\n\nProprietary AI can include hidden features like data harvesting for advertising and user profiling, embedded biases, and using your private data to refine the products without your consent. Open-source lets you make sure there are no hidden features or data backdoors – because you (and thousands, or even millions of others) can inspect the source code and understand how the software operates.\n\n\n\nIf your software is not anymore supported by a provider, you may lose valuable data like your AI’s memory of interactions. And even though normally you can export this data, there’s no guarantee it will be compatible with alternative models. With open-source, you don’t rely on a single vendor – the software will continue to exist, and you will retain full ownership. Moreover, you are not locked in the provider’s ecosystem of applications in order to fully benefit from their AI, no-one controls your costs, your updates and maintenance.\n\n\n\nYou can host your AI yourself or with a provider you trust, which means you fully control your data, make own decisions for your privacy, and maintain your compliance instead of relying on third-party services.\n\n\n\n\nNextcloud Ethical AI rating\n\n\n\nAt Nextcloud, we employ and integrate AI tools ourselves and we realize the risks brought by the evolving computer intelligence. That’s why we created the Ethical AI Rating that helps our users make the right decisions about what AI models to use in their work. It is more granular than the OSAID and more critical in areas like training data availability. For now, we will keep using it as it resonates with the unique needs of Nextcloud users.\n\n\n\n\nNextcloud Ethical AI Rating is based on three principles:\n\n\n\n\nWhether the training data is available and is free to use\n\n\n\nWhether the software (both for inferencing and training) is open-source\n\n\n\nWhether the trained model freely available for self-hosting\n\n\n\n\nBased on how many of the criteria are met, a model receives Red , Orange , Yellow  or Green  rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for open-source AI models to try? Consider these!\n\n\n\nNextcloud is not primarily an AI developer or vendor, so we don’t promote any AI products. Instead, we want to help our users choose the right tools to protect their privacy, and where needed, help them start using those tools through Nextcloud Hub. From the perspective of our Ethical AI Rating, here are several AI models that help you take control of your privacy.\n\n\n\n\nOpen-source LLMs via LocalAI \n\n\n\nWith LocalAI, you can use several open-source models like GPT-Neo or GPT-J, running them locally with ability to modify and interact with them on your server. In this case, the app also gets the Green rating in our Ethical AI rating, fully meeting the criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenNMT \n\n\n\nOpenNMT is a fully open-source AI translation framework available under MIT license. In Nextcloud, it can be used via LibreTranslate app that offers translation via your own server/API key.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpus \n\n\n\nOpus is a machine translation provider by University of Helsinki that runs locally on CPU and doesn’t let any private data leaves your servers. It meets all criteria of our rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT4All Falcon by Nomic AI \n\n\n\nGPT4All Falcon is an LLM that combines the Falcon language model with the GPT4All interface. It is available under Apache 2.0 license and runs locally on CPU.\n\n\n\n\nThere are models that do not match the criteria of the Green rating, but can be worth considering since they are self-hosted and have very permissive licenses, making them mostly safe to run locally:\n\n\n\n\nSelf-hosted Stable Diffusion \n\n\n\nStable Diffusion is open-source model licensed under CreativeML Open RAIL-M License. Users have full access to the model and its code, can modify and redistribute it, given that it’s an on-premises version. In Nextcloud, self-hosted Stable Diffusion can be used via LocalAI. We give it a Yellow rating, as the training data is not freely available in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhisper \n\n\n\nIn Nextcloud, you can use Whisper to enable speech-to-text conversion features. Whisper is available under the MIT License and has a Yellow rating due to limited availability of the training data.\n\n\n\n\n\nLlama 2 \n\n\n\nLlama 2 is a free LLM by Meta that can be run on-premises, and the software for training and inference of this model is open source. However, the training data is not freely available. It is offered under Llama 2 Community License.\n\n\n\n\nWe don’t limit our users’ choice of AI tools, and there are other models and apps that you can integrate in Nextcloud Hub and use with Nextcloud Assistant, including self-hosted models like NeuralBeagle14 7B, Smaug-72B and Meta’s Llama 3.

This is an important milestone. Let me explain why.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Open Source matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>In a world where speech depends on software, free speech depends on free software.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The key tenet of open source is is that it puts the user in control. Software is ever growing in complexity and importance in our society. Software is how we do our work, how we communicate, how we pay, how we access information. When software is a black box, subject to subtle (<a href=\"https://datasociety.net/research/media-manipulation/\">or not so much</a>) manipulation, users are at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Risks of AI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI brings these risks to an entirely new level. Not only because it makes decisions that are often entirely intransparent, but also because its easy, human like interface often lulls users to trust it far more than deserved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big AI firms have done their level best to ensure the attention of the public around risks with AI were aimed at existential, contrived notions akin to Skynet, the AI in the movie series Terminator, scenarios where AI would take over the world. In reality, the risks associated with AI are far more mundane. Surveillance, bias, explosive energy usage and job losses are the concerns we should focus on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Need for control</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And, just like with software, what matters is control. Who controls the AI, who makes decisions about what it can and can&#8217;t do, what goes in and what does not. With control, we can address the real risks of AI. Without control, we can simply hope that the billion dollar companies do the right thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They haven&#8217;t <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_Facebook\">in the past</a>. So we need Open Source AI. AI that that gives users the ability to study and modify the AI models that govern their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 33%\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nextcloud Ethical AI Rating <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f7e2.png\" alt=\"🟢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f7e1.png\" alt=\"🟡\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f7e0.png\" alt=\"🟠\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f534.png\" alt=\"🔴\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nextcloud gave this a <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-ethical-ai-rating/\">first shot in March 2023,</a> when we launched our Ethical AI Rating.

    "sanitized": "Today, the Open Source Initiative has released its first official definition of Open Source AI. This is an important milestone. Let me explain why.\n\n\n\nWhy Open Source matters\n\n\n\nIn a world where speech depends on software, free speech depends on free software.\n\n\n\nThe key tenet of open source is is that it puts the user in control. Software is ever growing in complexity and importance in our society. Software is how we do our work, how we communicate, how we pay, how we access information. When software is a black box, subject to subtle (or not so much) manipulation, users are at risk.\n\n\n\nRisks of AI\n\n\n\nAI brings these risks to an entirely new level. Not only because it makes decisions that are often entirely intransparent, but also because its easy, human like interface often lulls users to trust it far more than deserved.\n\n\n\nThe big AI firms have done their level best to ensure the attention of the public around risks with AI were aimed at existential, contrived notions akin to Skynet, the AI in the movie series Terminator, scenarios where AI would take over the world. In reality, the risks associated with AI are far more mundane. Surveillance, bias, explosive energy usage and job losses are the concerns we should focus on.\n\n\n\nNeed for control\n\n\n\nAnd, just like with software, what matters is control. Who controls the AI, who makes decisions about what it can and can’t do, what goes in and what does not. With control, we can address the real risks of AI. Without control, we can simply hope that the billion dollar companies do the right thing.\n\n\n\nThey haven’t in the past. So we need Open Source AI. AI that that gives users the ability to study and modify the AI models that govern their lives.\n\n\n\n\nNextcloud Ethical AI Rating \n\n\n\nNextcloud gave this a first shot in March 2023, when we launched our Ethical AI Rating. A simple traffic light would show with green/yellow/orange/red if a given AI model was freely available, if its data was publicly available and if the code needed to run and train it was open source. This way we help users make an informed decision without restricting their choice of models and features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n\t\t\t\t\tUsers of AI solutions deserve transparency and control, which is why we introduced our Ethical AI rating in early 2023. Now, we see big tech firms trying to hijack the term open source AI. We fully endorse the creation of a clear definition of open source AI by the community to protect users and the market.\nFrank KarlitschekCEO and fouder of Nextcloud                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wider open source community has picked up the gauntlet as well, and after extensive consultation with the community, today the OSI has announced an official definition of Open Source AI. This will help users, from private users, to governments, research institutes, hospitals and businesses, to make decisions what systems they can trust.\n\n\n\nSo, today, It is a first step in a journey and we are glad to be a part of it. Nextcloud has formally endorsed the definition, even if we think there is room for improvement. We will use it as a basis for our Ethical AI Rating. Our rating is a bit more granular and also more critical in some areas – for example, when it comes to data, we believe it should be always fully available – and thus, for now, we will keep using it, as it fits the use cases of our users more.\n\n\n\nWe look forward to your input, both on the OSI definition – on the road to a 2.0 – and on our AI rating.\nThe post Open Source AI is here appeared first on Nextcloud."
