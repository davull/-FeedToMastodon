This year has been a testament to that commitment. Together with the passion of our global team and the support of our community we have not just build the best open-source collaboration tools, but expanded our dedication to open source itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this annual wrap-up, we want to take a moment to celebrate this year&#8217;s achievements. Join us as we continue to reimagine what’s possible &#8211; shaping a world where open source, privacy and connection come together and drive progress for the greater good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>~ Nextcloud team </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"block-1b3b6ab7-bb3d-46b1-8216-6462116fee7d\">Charting global growth </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nextcloud is used around the world by private individuals, communities, enterprises, and governments. In 2024, millions of new users gained access through hundreds of new enterprise customers. In the wider community, exact numbers are difficult to come by but there are some 400-500K servers online and this number also continues to grow steadily, with tens of thousands of new deployments across the globe from the US to France, from Australia to Indonesia and South Africa to Hawaii.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These numbers convert in the change Nextcloud brings about, contributing to a more connected, privacy-respecting, transparent, and safer digital world &#8211; where we interact with government services, access our education, cast votes in elections, fill forms on websites and call our colleagues and friends through video chat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Change starts with people </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, our team has grown significantly, reflecting our success. With 20% increase in size we are now 118 strong united by a shared vision across 23 countries. That includes 7&nbsp;working students who get a chance to learn the ropes at Nextcloud. While we have expanded into a bigger office space in Berlin, we remain proudly remote-first, reflecting the flexibility and global collaboration that define our culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/12/nextcloud-community-conference-2024-group-photo-with-overlay.jpg\" alt=\"Nextcloud Community Conference 2024 group photo with overlay\" class=\"wp-image-276806\" srcset=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/12/nextcloud-community-conference-2024-group-photo-with-overlay.jpg 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/12/nextcloud-community-conference-2024-group-photo-with-overlay-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/12/nextcloud-community-conference-2024-group-photo-with-overlay-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/12/nextcloud-community-conference-2024-group-photo-with-overlay-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/12/nextcloud-community-conference-2024-group-photo-with-overlay-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A spirit of fellowship: Nextcloud community <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-224548\" style=\"width: 0px;\" src=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/06/conference-icon-blue-2.svg\" alt=\"\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As an open-source project, Nextcloud thrives not just on code but on the people behind it.

Such “malicious compliance” is one of the common instruments in the Big Tech arsenal used to resist the limiting market regulations. A legislation like EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) could <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-for-die-zeit-microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">protect fair competition further</a>, once it targets Microsoft’s cloud products that squeeze numerous local providers from the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this struggle still far from over, some results of our common efforts are evident. Earlier this year, Germany has officially <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/blog/germany-recognises-microsoft-as-tech-giant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recognized Microsoft as a tech giant</a> and made it “subject to extended abuse control”, three years since the formal antitrust complaint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the global IT so evidently lacks <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/blog/global-outage-shows-lack-of-digital-sovereignty-and-resilience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">digital sovereignty and resilience</a>, we naturally consider the fight for a fair trade a part of our mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AI with ethical integrity </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we said in one of the early introductions to our AI tools, some AI is hype and some is substance. And we want to give you the substance. Nextcloud does become a better version of itself with the evolving AI stack, helping you get some tasks done quicker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The back-end, the UX, the features, and the models you can use to power up Nextcloud Assistant &#8211; this year our engineers and contributors have done work to be proud of. From context-aware features with <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-releases-assistant-2-0-and-pushes-ai-as-a-service/\">Nextcloud Assistant 2.0</a> and chat UI and platform-wide integration in <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-hub9/\">Nextcloud Hub 9</a> to new <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/blog/how-open-source-ai-models-can-help-you-take-control-of-your-privacy/\">open-source AI</a> models &#8211; you can enjoy a fully AI-powered workspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most importantly, you stay in control of this powerful technology.

In August Nextcloud introduced the first official offering of enterprise support for Roundcube! It is tailored specifically for mail providers running large instances with thousands to millions of end users.&nbsp;We also offer our services to help businesses, universities and the public sector, but our offering makes the most sense for <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/blog/introducing-enterprise-support-for-roundcube/\">larger installations</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Process automation at scale with Nextcloud Flow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly before Nextcloud Hub 9, <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/de/\">Nextcloud</a> has presented the first <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/de/blog/press_releases/ozg-erste-open-source-plattform-fuer-einfache-umsetzung/\">automation-enabled open source platform</a> for implementing the Online Access Act (Onlinezugangsgesetz, OZG) in Germany and similar use cases in other countries. The Nextcloud Flow toolbox provides administrations with a digitally sovereign tool for offering and automating public services online and for exchanging the underlying processes among themselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BITV 2.0 certified Nextcloud</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nextcloud Enterprise has been awarded a German BITV 2.0 certification that is based on WCAG 2.0 benchmark. This means that the enterprise and public sector users can be confident in the accessibility standards of Nextcloud. The platform is designed with all users’ needs in mind, suitable for people with limitations and requirements for non-standard input devices and additional measures like a screen reader. Contact your sales representative if you require the certification.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns borderRadius has-background is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\" style=\"background-color:#e0edf8\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">News talk: In the spotlight </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list nc-list\">\n<li>Spanish newspaper <a href=\"https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/disruptores/grandes-actores/tecnologicas/20240917/empresa-protege-datos-csic-amnistia-internacional-frenando-abuso-tecnologicas/885911448_0.html\">El Espanol</a> reported on the Nextcloud Community Conference.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>German <a href=\"https://netzpolitik.org/2024/bundeskartellamt-legt-sich-bei-microsoft-auf-die-lauer/\">netzpolitik.org</a> and others reported on the update regarding the complaint against Microsoft.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>German newspaper <a href=\"https://background.tagesspiegel.de/digitalisierung-und-ki/briefing/open-source-als-wegbereiter-digitaler-souveraenitaet\">Der Tagesspiegel</a> published a bylined article by Frank Karlitschek on open source as a pioneer of digital sovereignty.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weekly newspaper <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2024-07/microsoft-pakete-software-eu-kommission\">Die Zeit</a> published an article on Microsoft’s practices of bundling following an interview with Frank Karlitschek. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sz-dossier.de/newsletters/digitalwende/2024-12-19-schleswig-holstein-ohne-microsoft-so-laeuft-die-umstellung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Süddeutsche Zeitung Dossier</a> published an article exploring the transition of Schleswig-Holstein state administration from Microsoft, featuring a conversation with Frank Karlitschek and Dirk Schrödter of Schleswig-Holstein.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-fill\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://nextcloud.com/press/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Press?

Over two hundred enterprise and public decision makers attended our first event in Frankfurt in 2024. Featuring keynotes by leading voices across industries, product announcements and roadmap sneak peeks, and ample opportunities for networking and optimizing your platform, it provides a premier setting to explore and advance privacy, digital sovereignty, and digitalization.

    "sanitized": "We at Nextcloud have remained true to our vision: empowering collaboration without compromising on privacy. This year has been a testament to that commitment. Together with the passion of our global team and the support of our community we have not just build the best open-source collaboration tools, but expanded our dedication to open source itself.\n\n\n\nIn this annual wrap-up, we want to take a moment to celebrate this year’s achievements. Join us as we continue to reimagine what’s possible – shaping a world where open source, privacy and connection come together and drive progress for the greater good. \n\n\n\n~ Nextcloud team \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharting global growth \n\n\n\nNextcloud is used around the world by private individuals, communities, enterprises, and governments. In 2024, millions of new users gained access through hundreds of new enterprise customers. In the wider community, exact numbers are difficult to come by but there are some 400-500K servers online and this number also continues to grow steadily, with tens of thousands of new deployments across the globe from the US to France, from Australia to Indonesia and South Africa to Hawaii.\n\n\n\nThese numbers convert in the change Nextcloud brings about, contributing to a more connected, privacy-respecting, transparent, and safer digital world – where we interact with government services, access our education, cast votes in elections, fill forms on websites and call our colleagues and friends through video chat.\n\n\n\nChange starts with people \n\n\n\nThis year, our team has grown significantly, reflecting our success. With 20% increase in size we are now 118 strong united by a shared vision across 23 countries. That includes 7 working students who get a chance to learn the ropes at Nextcloud. While we have expanded into a bigger office space in Berlin, we remain proudly remote-first, reflecting the flexibility and global collaboration that define our culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA spirit of fellowship: Nextcloud community \n\n\n\nAs an open-source project, Nextcloud thrives not just on code but on the people behind it. Thanks to all the developers, translators, maintainers, and other enthusiasts that contribute, Nextcloud has grown into the platform of choice for those who value privacy, security, and transparency. Let us share some facts about Nextcloud in 2024!\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t38k+ GitHub commits Made this year by the Nextcloud team and community.\n11.3k+ new forum members +8,4K new topics and +41.7 new posts on the Nextcloud Community forum.\n100+ security experts thanked Our engineers responded to reports in 5 hours on average, with 100% response efficiency.\n100+ languages Thanks to the translator community, Nextcloud is available in 107 languages, 41 exceeding 50% completion.\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to listen to the podcast episode!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaping collaboration of tomorrow with Nextcloud Hub \n\n\n\nThe efficient Nextcloud Hub 8\n\n\n\nLaunching Nextcloud Hub 8 under the “Regain control over your time” theme, we made it all about efficiency. With Nextcloud Assistant 2.0 bringing innovative AI features, interactive widgets connecting our apps further, advancing chat and sharing tools and ambitious architecture undertakings, this release gave you more control than ever before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe connected Nextcloud Hub 9\n\n\n\nOur latest release brought a major visual redesign to the platform, resulting in a slicker experience all around. But it’s not all about the looks – with a growing stack of federation features, automation centralizing under Nextcloud Flow, and further efforts to elevate performance and scaling, Nextcloud Hub 9 made headlines this September as an “Explosive release”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNextcloud Talk: the open-source answer to Teams\n\n\n\nIn an unrestful world of today, dependency on centralized, opaque systems under strong foreign influence is a ticking clock. It is time the open-source world had a real answer to Microsoft Teams. Nextcloud Talk is the only open-source conferencing hub that seamlessly integrates chats, video meetings and webinar functionality in one powerful, privacy-respecting platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are wrapping up 2024 with a strong standalone release of Nextcloud Talk, celebrating its reinvention within Nextcloud’s product portfolio. New desktop application, new AI features, new streaming capabilities, simplified and mindful collaboration, and reinforced security (again!) – we invite you to meet the new Nextcloud Talk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanding ground against Big Tech \n\n\n\nIn an attempt to slow down the antitrust case backed by Nextcloud and other members of the Coalition for level playing field, Microsoft has unbundled Teams from the Windows ecosystem. Such “malicious compliance” is one of the common instruments in the Big Tech arsenal used to resist the limiting market regulations. A legislation like EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) could protect fair competition further, once it targets Microsoft’s cloud products that squeeze numerous local providers from the market.\n\n\n\nWith this struggle still far from over, some results of our common efforts are evident. Earlier this year, Germany has officially recognized Microsoft as a tech giant and made it “subject to extended abuse control”, three years since the formal antitrust complaint.\n\n\n\nWhen the global IT so evidently lacks digital sovereignty and resilience, we naturally consider the fight for a fair trade a part of our mission.\n\n\n\nAI with ethical integrity \n\n\n\nLike we said in one of the early introductions to our AI tools, some AI is hype and some is substance. And we want to give you the substance. Nextcloud does become a better version of itself with the evolving AI stack, helping you get some tasks done quicker.\n\n\n\nThe back-end, the UX, the features, and the models you can use to power up Nextcloud Assistant – this year our engineers and contributors have done work to be proud of. From context-aware features with Nextcloud Assistant 2.0 and chat UI and platform-wide integration in Nextcloud Hub 9 to new open-source AI models – you can enjoy a fully AI-powered workspace.\n\n\n\nAnd most importantly, you stay in control of this powerful technology. To build the system that you can rely on and keep your data yours, you can refer to our Ethical AI Rating and decide what AI you want to use in Nextcloud Hub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady for mission-critical, enterprise deployment \n\n\n\nEnterprise support for Roundcube\n\n\n\nSince Roundcube joined us, Nextcloud began to receive requests from large hosting companies for support. In August Nextcloud introduced the first official offering of enterprise support for Roundcube! It is tailored specifically for mail providers running large instances with thousands to millions of end users. We also offer our services to help businesses, universities and the public sector, but our offering makes the most sense for larger installations. \n\n\n\nProcess automation at scale with Nextcloud Flow\n\n\n\nShortly before Nextcloud Hub 9, Nextcloud has presented the first automation-enabled open source platform for implementing the Online Access Act (Onlinezugangsgesetz, OZG) in Germany and similar use cases in other countries. The Nextcloud Flow toolbox provides administrations with a digitally sovereign tool for offering and automating public services online and for exchanging the underlying processes among themselves. \n\n\n\nBITV 2.0 certified Nextcloud\n\n\n\nNextcloud Enterprise has been awarded a German BITV 2.0 certification that is based on WCAG 2.0 benchmark. This means that the enterprise and public sector users can be confident in the accessibility standards of Nextcloud.

Microsoft&#8217;s recommendation? Move, of course, to their subscription-only Microsoft 365 offering which changes the scope of data privacy, access, and the financial relationship SME&#8217;s depend on — becoming subject to sudden price changes, like the previous <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/1614963/microsoft-plots-price-hikes-for-most-office-microsoft-365-subscriptions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">up-to-25% price hikes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe there&#8217;s a need for a real alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The clock is ticking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently more than 80% of small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) in Germany use Microsoft Office packages that <a href=\"https://www.intra2net.com/en/company/press/press-release.php_id=58.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">will have reached end-of-life next year</a>, including Office 2016 and Office 2019. Essentially, &#8220;support for Office 2016 and Office 2019 will end on October 14, 2025 and there will be no extension and no extended security updates.&#8221; <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/end-of-support-for-office-2016-and-office-2019-818c68bc-d5e5-47e5-b52f-ddf636cf8e16\">states</a> Microsoft. Without an upgrade &#8220;you could expose yourself to serious and potentially harmful security risks.&#8221; And… they&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why businesses hesitate with Microsoft 365</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft&#8217;s recommendation to move to Microsoft 365 carries significant implications for essential everyday office tools in enterprises. Data show that enterprises are <a href=\"https://www.intra2net.com/en/company/press/press-release.php_id=58.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hesitating to upgrade</a>, with market share of Office 2010, 2013, 2015 and 2019 remaining stable in the last 24 months. Why the hesitation to upgrade?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can think of a few reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The financial implications</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The soon-to-expire versions of Microsoft Office follow the traditional licensing model, which SMEs expect and appreciate for it&#8217;s predictability. With Microsoft&#8217;s suggested move to Office 365, that model gets thrown away for the monthly subscription model with cloud services. Which leads us to question…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Why does Big Tech love subscriptions?</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Price control: increased prices at any time</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s an incentive to lock you into recurring pricing through subscriptions that cause price control: the ability for them to raise prices at any point, leaving SMEs at the mercy of their new subscription overlords.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason this is so effective?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cancelling is painful: the vendor lock-in guarantee</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Subscription models provide a perfect vendor lock-in scenario, creating this dependency and making it both difficult and costly to switch providers if the service does not meet expectations. Another step to this vendor lock-in includes the technical challenges associated with a massive migration from a subscription service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What about my data privacy?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it acceptable that internal documents, Intellectual Property, and private communications are the new building blocks for Microsoft&#8217;s AI models?</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:26px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image imageRoundShadow\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/blog/how-open-source-ai-models-can-help-you-take-control-of-your-privacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/How-open-source-AI-models-help-you-take-control-of-your-privacy.png\" alt=\"How open-source AI models help you take control of your privacy\" class=\"wp-image-269501\" srcset=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/How-open-source-AI-models-help-you-take-control-of-your-privacy.png 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/How-open-source-AI-models-help-you-take-control-of-your-privacy-300x169.png 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/How-open-source-AI-models-help-you-take-control-of-your-privacy-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/How-open-source-AI-models-help-you-take-control-of-your-privacy-768x432.png 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/How-open-source-AI-models-help-you-take-control-of-your-privacy-1536x864.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:26px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving to Microsoft 365 also drastically changes the expectations of data privacy, sovereignty, and transparency.

    "sanitized": "By 2025 the most popular Microsoft Office products fall out of support, including the most widely used Office versions: Microsoft Office 2016 and 2019. Microsoft’s recommendation? Move, of course, to their subscription-only Microsoft 365 offering which changes the scope of data privacy, access, and the financial relationship SME’s depend on — becoming subject to sudden price changes, like the previous up-to-25% price hikes.\n\n\n\nWe believe there’s a need for a real alternative.\n\n\n\nThe clock is ticking\n\n\n\nCurrently more than 80% of small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) in Germany use Microsoft Office packages that will have reached end-of-life next year, including Office 2016 and Office 2019. Essentially, “support for Office 2016 and Office 2019 will end on October 14, 2025 and there will be no extension and no extended security updates.” states Microsoft. Without an upgrade “you could expose yourself to serious and potentially harmful security risks.” And… they’re right.\n\n\n\nWhy businesses hesitate with Microsoft 365\n\n\n\nMicrosoft’s recommendation to move to Microsoft 365 carries significant implications for essential everyday office tools in enterprises. Data show that enterprises are hesitating to upgrade, with market share of Office 2010, 2013, 2015 and 2019 remaining stable in the last 24 months. Why the hesitation to upgrade?\n\n\n\nWe can think of a few reasons.\n\n\n\nThe financial implications\n\n\n\nThe soon-to-expire versions of Microsoft Office follow the traditional licensing model, which SMEs expect and appreciate for it’s predictability. With Microsoft’s suggested move to Office 365, that model gets thrown away for the monthly subscription model with cloud services. Which leads us to question…\n\n\n\nWhy does Big Tech love subscriptions?\n\n\n\nPrice control: increased prices at any time\n\n\n\nThere’s an incentive to lock you into recurring pricing through subscriptions that cause price control: the ability for them to raise prices at any point, leaving SMEs at the mercy of their new subscription overlords.\n\n\n\nThe reason this is so effective?\n\n\n\nCancelling is painful: the vendor lock-in guarantee\n\n\n\nSubscription models provide a perfect vendor lock-in scenario, creating this dependency and making it both difficult and costly to switch providers if the service does not meet expectations. Another step to this vendor lock-in includes the technical challenges associated with a massive migration from a subscription service.\n\n\n\nWhat about my data privacy?\n\n\n\nIs it acceptable that internal documents, Intellectual Property, and private communications are the new building blocks for Microsoft’s AI models?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving to Microsoft 365 also drastically changes the expectations of data privacy, sovereignty, and transparency. With the suggestion to move the entire office suite to Microsoft’s cloud, your data may no longer be solely yours.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft’s Privacy Statement even states “As part of our efforts to improve and develop our products, we may use your data to develop and train our AI models.”\n\n\n\nEven the European Commission this year was found to infringe on its own EU data protection laws through its use of Microsoft 365, which “failed […] to ensure that personal data transferred outside the EU are afforded an essentially equivalent level of protection as guaranteed in the EU.”\n\n\n\nNextcloud Office: refreshing alternative to Microsoft technologies\n\n\n\nNextcloud Office presents a migration path that addresses all of these Big Tech problems, from the grips of vendor lock-in to the critical data privacy concerns. It’s your ideal Microsoft 365 alternative!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy allowing self-hosting on secure and self-controlled servers, or with trusted sovereign cloud hosting partners, Nextcloud Office prioritizes your data sovereignty and GDPR compliance. This gives Nextcloud an edge over Microsoft 365, where data is stored on Microsoft’s servers and may be subject to access by US authorities.\n\n\n\nIn addition to real-time collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, Nextcloud Office also seamlessly integrates with other Nextcloud apps like Nextcloud Talk and Nextcloud Groupware applications, enhancing overall team productivity.\n\n\n\nSuccess in Germany’s federal state\n\n\n\nFrom the public sector, the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein in Germany migrated away from the grasp of subscription models into Nextcloud’s suite of open source, data sovereign solutions including Nextcloud Office. This transition has been explored in details by Schleswig-Holstein’s CIO Sven Thomsen in a recent episode of the Nextcloud Podcast.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n\t\t\t\t\tWith the adoption of Nextcloud Office in the last years, the value proposition that Nextcloud put into place totally changed for us: Nextcloud migrated in our view from a simple OneDrive alternative to becoming our central hub for collaboration and collaborative document editing. From an IT operations point of view, Nextcloud being open source is the perfect implementation path as a new solution.\nSven ThomsenCIO of Schleswig-Holstein                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to the podcast!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigrating to Nextcloud?

It is the only solution on the market which deeply integrates video calls, team chat and large group call features with real-time document collaboration and file sharing, and has become critical to the functioning of many organizations. Which, in turn, has allowed Microsoft to hike prices by 20 to 40% and not face an exodus of customers – as they and their data are fully locked in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations, small and large, need a way to ensure the resiliency and digital sovereignty of their operations – an open source, privacy respecting alternative to Teams. And today, we present that solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Introducing the Open Source answer to Microsoft Teams\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1035504262?h=776fa1186e&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In this short webinar, Jos walks you through how Nextcloud Talk takes on Microsoft Teams!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Welcome to Nextcloud Talk</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, live from our Enterprise day in Paris, we launch Nextcloud Talk „Paris“. It is the <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/talk/#compare\">only open-source solution that integrates all key features</a> – from chats and video conferencing to webinars, complete with file sharing and office document editing – into a single platform while avoiding vendor lock-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our platform meets the highest standards of compliance with privacy legislations like GDPR or HIPAA and offers strict data security, ensuring full data control. Thanks to its open architecture, Talk can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems and tailored to individual needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nextcloud Talk is designed to address three key use cases. Let’s go quickly over them!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Efficient team chat</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The integrated chat in Nextcloud Talk is designed to help teams stay connected throughout the workday. With multiple chat rooms and the ability to edit files directly within the chat, Talk streamlines hybrid team collaboration and boosts efficiency. End-to-end encryption ensures that calls remain private and secure, while integrated real-time notifications keep everyone in the loop. All data stays under your control, meeting the highest privacy and security standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It features deep integration with a wide variety of content. Users can add documents &#8211; and edit them right there, inline, without having to open tabs or download the file. Locations, tasks, calendars and notes can all be inserted, viewed and edited without leaving Talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:29px\" aria-hidden=\"true\"

When your colleague calls you while you’re out, your phone will ring and you’ll be able to share your screen to show them a quick presentation you’re working on.</p>\n\n\n<section class=\"simple-slider-section \" id=\"\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n                    <div class=\"owl-carousel simple_slider_slideshow\" id=\"\">\n                                    <div class=\"gallery_item\" id=\"271774\">\n                        <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy.jpg\" class=\"simple_slider_slideshow_link\">\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy.jpg 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-webinar-in-action-copy-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" />                        </a>\n                                            </div>\n                                    <div class=\"gallery_item\" id=\"271754\">\n                        <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy.jpg\" class=\"simple_slider_slideshow_link\">\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy.jpg 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-call-presenting-copy-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" />                        </a>\n                                            </div>\n                                    <div class=\"gallery_item\" id=\"271759\">\n                        <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy.jpg\" class=\"simple_slider_slideshow_link\">\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy.jpg 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/11/Talk-room-moderation-settings-copy-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" />                        </a>\n                                            </div>\n                            </ul>\n        \t</div>\n</section>\n<script type=\"rocketlazyloadscript\">\n    jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {\n        var owl_simple_slider = $('.simple_slider_slideshow');\n        owl_simple_slider.owlCarousel({\n            loop:true,\n            stagePadding: 50,\n            autoplay: true,\n            margin:10,\n            dots: false,\n            nav:true,\n            responsive:{\n                0:{\n                    items:1\n                },\n                600:{\n                    items:1\n                },\n                800:{\n                    items:1\n                },\n                1000:{\n                    items:1\n                }\n            },\n            onDragged: owl_stop_autoplay,\n            autoplayHoverPause:true\n        });\n\n        owl_simple_slider.on('click', function(e) {\n            owl_stop_autoplay();\n        });\n        function owl_stop_autoplay() {\n            //console.log('autoplay stopped.');\n            owl_simple_slider.trigger('stop.owl.autoplay');\n        }\n\n    });\n</script>\n\n\n\n<p>You can give participants a phone number to dial in to, and even pull them in by dialing out right from Talk.

You can send silent chat messages and even start silent calls which don&#8217;t send notifications to everyone. User status communicates to colleagues if you&#8217;re available or not &#8211; the status will automatically change when you are in a call or have an appointment in your calendar, and your time zone is visible for others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need to deal with something &#8211; but not right now? You can mark a chat as unread, but also set a reminder on an individual message. You&#8217;ll get a notification at the time you set! You can also send a message to a special &#8216;Note to self&#8217; chat, or put notes there by hand. Keep things organized for yourself. Perhaps favorite your Note to self chat so it&#8217;s always on top with other important chats?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also set your work hours and enable do-not-disturb outside those hours. Calls give a warning at the 1h mark and can now automatically end after a set time. And, during calls, you can see how much each participant talked so you can make sure even the quiet team members get to have their say.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">High-security communication</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nextcloud Talk meets the highest security standards and can even be deployed in airgap environments, keeping all communication strictly away from the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>Discover more new features</summary>\n<p>Calls:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Summarize Call recordings automatically with AI</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enforce a maximum call lenght</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option to always disable devices by default</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option to download a call participants list</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option to blur background by default</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Chat:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Summary of chat histories when there are many unread messages</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option to directly download attachments</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Highlight file and object shares with an icon in conversations list</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Guests:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Identify and recognize guests invited via mail address</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allow inviting email guests when creating a conversation</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Option to archive conversations</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Automatically lock rooms after days of inactivity</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Voice Messages:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Auto play voice messages which are grouped together</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Polls:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Draft, import and export polls</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:29px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A glimpse into the future of collaboration</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With Nextcloud Talk, we empower companies and public institutions to work securely and productively – regardless of their location or infrastructure.

    "sanitized": "When cables are cut, sanctions are put in place or privacy legislation prohibits the use of the service your entire organization depends on, what can you do?\n\n\n\nAmidst geo-political changes, organizations face dependencies on large, centralized communication platforms. A major example of this is the SaaS-only communication platform Microsoft Teams. It is the only solution on the market which deeply integrates video calls, team chat and large group call features with real-time document collaboration and file sharing, and has become critical to the functioning of many organizations. Which, in turn, has allowed Microsoft to hike prices by 20 to 40% and not face an exodus of customers – as they and their data are fully locked in.\n\n\n\nOrganisations, small and large, need a way to ensure the resiliency and digital sovereignty of their operations – an open source, privacy respecting alternative to Teams. And today, we present that solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this short webinar, Jos walks you through how Nextcloud Talk takes on Microsoft Teams!\n\n\n\nWelcome to Nextcloud Talk\n\n\n\nToday, live from our Enterprise day in Paris, we launch Nextcloud Talk „Paris“. It is the only open-source solution that integrates all key features – from chats and video conferencing to webinars, complete with file sharing and office document editing – into a single platform while avoiding vendor lock-in.\n\n\n\nOur platform meets the highest standards of compliance with privacy legislations like GDPR or HIPAA and offers strict data security, ensuring full data control. Thanks to its open architecture, Talk can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems and tailored to individual needs.\n\n\n\nNextcloud Talk is designed to address three key use cases. Let’s go quickly over them!\n\n\n\nEfficient team chat\n\n\n\nThe integrated chat in Nextcloud Talk is designed to help teams stay connected throughout the workday. With multiple chat rooms and the ability to edit files directly within the chat, Talk streamlines hybrid team collaboration and boosts efficiency. End-to-end encryption ensures that calls remain private and secure, while integrated real-time notifications keep everyone in the loop. All data stays under your control, meeting the highest privacy and security standards.\n\n\n\nIt features deep integration with a wide variety of content. Users can add documents – and edit them right there, inline, without having to open tabs or download the file. Locations, tasks, calendars and notes can all be inserted, viewed and edited without leaving Talk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n                    \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                            \n        \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo calls for seamless collaboration\n\n\n\nNextcloud Talk makes virtual meetings easy and accessible across devices. Whether it’s a quick check-in or a larger team meeting, our platform ensures powerful collaboration for hybrid working teams. Features like integrated whiteboards, screen sharing, and joint document editing make real-time collaboration easier than ever. Scheduling and joining calls is effortless, directly from the Nextcloud interface, integrated with the calendar app for easy scheduling of meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n                    \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                            \n        \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive webinars, education and training sessions\n\n\n\nTalk enables you to host engaging webinars – bringing audiences like teams, students, or customers together. The platform supports live streaming, Q&A sessions and screensharing and comes with moderation features. Functions like the integrated chat, animated reactions, polls and breakout rooms make the learning experience more interactive and fun. All this, and more, is available wherever you are. Not only in the browser, but also with apps on iOS and Android! When your colleague calls you while you’re out, your phone will ring and you’ll be able to share your screen to show them a quick presentation you’re working on.\n\n\n\n\t\n                    \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                                    \n                        \n                                                    \n                                            \n                            \n        \t\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can give participants a phone number to dial in to, and even pull them in by dialing out right from Talk. Need to add hundreds, even thousands of participants? Simply import a spreadsheet. After the call, you export the participant list and see who did and did not show up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak up big groups in breakout rooms, enabling everyone to be productive in a smaller team before coming back together to the big group. In your breakout room you can do a call, chat, work on a whiteboard, share documents and more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerous new features for better collaboration\n\n\n\nNew desktop app\n\n\n\nNo more searching through browser tabs! The new app offers desktop integration and notifications, allowing users to communicate and join calls effortlessly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew AI features\n\n\n\nTired of taking notes in long meetings? Enjoy our automatically generated summaries of video meetings! Dreading those 173 unread messages in the morning? The Nextcloud Assistant summarizes them for you. Less work, less stress!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual collaboration\n\n\n\nThe interactive whiteboard enables teams to brainstorm and develop ideas in real-time – ideal for workshops and project planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan your polls\n\n\n\nYou can now save a poll as a draft, for quick publishing when the class has started. Need to use the same poll in a different class? Simply export it as a file and import it in the new room. At the end, export the poll as image or spreadsheet. Easy as pie!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplified teamwork\n\n\n\nDocuments can be collaboratively edited directly within chats or video calls. No need to switch to another window or tab! You can easily find chat messages with the search, leave and join open chat rooms or archive the ones you no longer follow, so you stay as connected as you need to be.\n\n\n\nLet colleagues know what you think with reactions to chat messages, or animated reactions during calls. And if you need to make a point, you can use bold, italics, headers and even tables in your messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMindfulness features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo promote a healthy meeting culture, Nextcloud Talk has a series of small features that help you be mindful of yourself and others. You can send silent chat messages and even start silent calls which don’t send notifications to everyone. User status communicates to colleagues if you’re available or not – the status will automatically change when you are in a call or have an appointment in your calendar, and your time zone is visible for others.\n\n\n\nNeed to deal with something – but not right now? You can mark a chat as unread, but also set a reminder on an individual message. You’ll get a notification at the time you set! You can also send a message to a special ‘Note to self’ chat, or put notes there by hand. Keep things organized for yourself. Perhaps favorite your Note to self chat so it’s always on top with other important chats?\n\n\n\nYou can also set your work hours and enable do-not-disturb outside those hours. Calls give a warning at the 1h mark and can now automatically end after a set time. And, during calls, you can see how much each participant talked so you can make sure even the quiet team members get to have their say.\n\n\n\nHigh-security communication\n\n\n\nNextcloud Talk meets the highest security standards and can even be deployed in airgap environments, keeping all communication strictly away from the internet.\n\n\n\nDiscover more new features\nCalls:\n\n\n\n\nSummarize Call recordings automatically with AI\n\n\n\nEnforce a maximum call lenght\n\n\n\nOption to always disable devices by default\n\n\n\nOption to download a call participants list\n\n\n\nOption to blur background by default\n\n\n\n\nChat:\n\n\n\n\nSummary of chat histories when there are many unread messages\n\n\n\nOption to directly download attachments\n\n\n\nHighlight file and object shares with an icon in conversations list\n\n\n\n\nGuests:\n\n\n\n\nIdentify and recognize guests invited via mail address\n\n\n\nAllow inviting email guests when creating a conversation\n\n\n\n\nConversations:\n\n\n\n\nOption to archive conversations\n\n\n\nAutomatically lock rooms after days of inactivity\n\n\n\n\nVoice Messages:\n\n\n\n\nAuto play voice messages which are grouped together\n\n\n\n\nPolls:\n\n\n\n\nDraft, import and export polls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA glimpse into the future of collaboration\n\n\n\nWith Nextcloud Talk, we empower companies and public institutions to work securely and productively – regardless of their location or infrastructure. The platform is ideal for on premise installations or hosting by local cloud providers, giving companies and organizations full control over their data.\n\n\n\nFinally, the open source community has a real answer to Microsoft Teams. \n\n\n\nLearn more at the Talk webpage, or join our upcoming webinar to find out how Talk can replace Teams for your organization!\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGet started with Nextcloud TalkLearn more about Nextcloud Talk and get started right away!\nLearn more\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nThe post The open source answer to Microsoft Teams appeared first on Nextcloud."

An alternative is open-source AI models which, much like open-source software, have a potential to give you more transparency and control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can study and even modify the model you are using, and if you don&#8217;t need that — at least understand how your data is processed, stored and shared. Sounds like something the viral AI photo editing apps can’t promise, yet millions keep giving them access to their private photos every day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join us as we explore how open-source AI benefits users and, from the perspective of our Ethical AI rating, provide examples of AI models that can help you reclaim your privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are open-source AI models?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With more people becoming aware of how data economy works, earning user’s trust becomes more challenging to the AI providers. To appeal to more conscious users, many AI vendors label their technology open or open-source. But without consensus on what open-source AI is, such open-washing could raise many risks: surveillance, information bias, effects on the labor market and creative industries, and excessive energy usage — to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In attempt to battle the potentially harmful trend, the Open Source Initiative released its official <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/blog/open-source-ai-is-here/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Open Source Artificial Intelligence Definition (OSAID)</a>. According to the OSAID, an Open Source AI is an AI system made available under terms and in a way that grant the freedoms&nbsp;to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list nc-list\">\n<li>Use&nbsp;the system for any purpose and without having to ask for permission.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Study&nbsp;how the system works and inspect its components.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Modify&nbsp;the system for any purpose, including to change its output.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share&nbsp;the system for others to use with or without modifications, for any purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the work on this definition has been endorsed by many companies and individuals, there&#8217;s no consensus in the community on whether or not to accept it in its current state, or if the open-source AI is even ready to be defined. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We too think there&#8217;s room for improvement. But with or without concrete definition for the OS AI, we can tell how four main freedoms of open-source &#8211; to use, to study, to modify, and to share &#8211; can impact life of the the AI users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do users benefit from open-source AI?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source promotes freedom and empowers users to control their software &#8211; in this case, the AI &#8211; they rely on. Here are several examples of opens-source AI systems could directly benefit you as a user:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list nc-list\">\n<li>Proprietary AI can include hidden features like data harvesting for advertising and user profiling, embedded biases, and using your private data to refine the products without your consent. Open-source lets you make sure there are no hidden features or data backdoors &#8211; because you (and thousands, or even millions of others) can inspect the source code and understand how the software operates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If your software is not anymore supported by a provider, you may lose valuable data like your AI’s memory of interactions. And even though normally you can export this data, there’s no guarantee it will be compatible with alternative models. With open-source, you don’t rely on a single vendor &#8211; the software will continue to exist, and you will retain full ownership. Moreover, you are not locked in the provider’s ecosystem of applications in order to fully benefit from their AI, no-one controls your costs, your updates and maintenance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can host your AI yourself or with a provider you trust, which means you fully control your data, make own decisions for your privacy, and maintain your compliance instead of relying on third-party services.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nextcloud Ethical AI rating</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Nextcloud, we employ and integrate AI tools ourselves and we realize the risks brought by the evolving computer intelligence. That’s why we created the <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-ethical-ai-rating/\">Ethical AI Rating</a> that helps our users make the right decisions about what AI models to use in their work. It is more granular than the OSAID and more critical in areas like training data availability. For now, we will keep using it as it resonates with the unique needs of Nextcloud users.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:36% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2023/03/nextcloud-ethical-AI-logo-1.svg\" alt=\"Nextcloud Ethical AI\" class=\"wp-image-108526 size-full\"/></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Nextcloud Ethical AI Rating is based on three principles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list nc-list\">\n<li>Whether the training data is available and is free to use</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Whether the software (both for inferencing and training) is open-source</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Whether the trained model freely available for self-hosting</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on how many of the criteria are met, a model receives Red <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f534.png\" alt=\"🔴\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />, Orange <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f7e0.png\" alt=\"🟠\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />, Yellow <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f7e1.png\" alt=\"🟡\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> or Green <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f7e2.png\" alt=\"🟢\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> rating.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking for open-source AI models to try?

    "sanitized": "AI tools woven into the big tech ecosystems, some more “open” than others, some more quiet, often require a silent sacrifice in exchange for easy-to-access technology. An alternative is open-source AI models which, much like open-source software, have a potential to give you more transparency and control.\n\n\n\nYou can study and even modify the model you are using, and if you don’t need that — at least understand how your data is processed, stored and shared. Sounds like something the viral AI photo editing apps can’t promise, yet millions keep giving them access to their private photos every day. \n\n\n\nJoin us as we explore how open-source AI benefits users and, from the perspective of our Ethical AI rating, provide examples of AI models that can help you reclaim your privacy.\n\n\n\nWhat are open-source AI models?\n\n\n\nWith more people becoming aware of how data economy works, earning user’s trust becomes more challenging to the AI providers. To appeal to more conscious users, many AI vendors label their technology open or open-source. But without consensus on what open-source AI is, such open-washing could raise many risks: surveillance, information bias, effects on the labor market and creative industries, and excessive energy usage — to name a few.\n\n\n\nIn attempt to battle the potentially harmful trend, the Open Source Initiative released its official Open Source Artificial Intelligence Definition (OSAID). According to the OSAID, an Open Source AI is an AI system made available under terms and in a way that grant the freedoms to:\n\n\n\n\nUse the system for any purpose and without having to ask for permission.\n\n\n\nStudy how the system works and inspect its components.\n\n\n\nModify the system for any purpose, including to change its output.\n\n\n\nShare the system for others to use with or without modifications, for any purpose.\n\n\n\n\nEven though the work on this definition has been endorsed by many companies and individuals, there’s no consensus in the community on whether or not to accept it in its current state, or if the open-source AI is even ready to be defined. \n\n\n\nWe too think there’s room for improvement. But with or without concrete definition for the OS AI, we can tell how four main freedoms of open-source – to use, to study, to modify, and to share – can impact life of the the AI users.\n\n\n\nHow do users benefit from open-source AI?\n\n\n\nOpen source promotes freedom and empowers users to control their software – in this case, the AI – they rely on. Here are several examples of opens-source AI systems could directly benefit you as a user:\n\n\n\n\nProprietary AI can include hidden features like data harvesting for advertising and user profiling, embedded biases, and using your private data to refine the products without your consent. Open-source lets you make sure there are no hidden features or data backdoors – because you (and thousands, or even millions of others) can inspect the source code and understand how the software operates.\n\n\n\nIf your software is not anymore supported by a provider, you may lose valuable data like your AI’s memory of interactions. And even though normally you can export this data, there’s no guarantee it will be compatible with alternative models. With open-source, you don’t rely on a single vendor – the software will continue to exist, and you will retain full ownership. Moreover, you are not locked in the provider’s ecosystem of applications in order to fully benefit from their AI, no-one controls your costs, your updates and maintenance.\n\n\n\nYou can host your AI yourself or with a provider you trust, which means you fully control your data, make own decisions for your privacy, and maintain your compliance instead of relying on third-party services.\n\n\n\n\nNextcloud Ethical AI rating\n\n\n\nAt Nextcloud, we employ and integrate AI tools ourselves and we realize the risks brought by the evolving computer intelligence. That’s why we created the Ethical AI Rating that helps our users make the right decisions about what AI models to use in their work. It is more granular than the OSAID and more critical in areas like training data availability. For now, we will keep using it as it resonates with the unique needs of Nextcloud users.\n\n\n\n\nNextcloud Ethical AI Rating is based on three principles:\n\n\n\n\nWhether the training data is available and is free to use\n\n\n\nWhether the software (both for inferencing and training) is open-source\n\n\n\nWhether the trained model freely available for self-hosting\n\n\n\n\nBased on how many of the criteria are met, a model receives Red , Orange , Yellow  or Green  rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for open-source AI models to try? Consider these!\n\n\n\nNextcloud is not primarily an AI developer or vendor, so we don’t promote any AI products. Instead, we want to help our users choose the right tools to protect their privacy, and where needed, help them start using those tools through Nextcloud Hub. From the perspective of our Ethical AI Rating, here are several AI models that help you take control of your privacy.\n\n\n\n\nOpen-source LLMs via LocalAI \n\n\n\nWith LocalAI, you can use several open-source models like GPT-Neo or GPT-J, running them locally with ability to modify and interact with them on your server. In this case, the app also gets the Green rating in our Ethical AI rating, fully meeting the criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenNMT \n\n\n\nOpenNMT is a fully open-source AI translation framework available under MIT license. In Nextcloud, it can be used via LibreTranslate app that offers translation via your own server/API key.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpus \n\n\n\nOpus is a machine translation provider by University of Helsinki that runs locally on CPU and doesn’t let any private data leaves your servers. It meets all criteria of our rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT4All Falcon by Nomic AI \n\n\n\nGPT4All Falcon is an LLM that combines the Falcon language model with the GPT4All interface. It is available under Apache 2.0 license and runs locally on CPU.\n\n\n\n\nThere are models that do not match the criteria of the Green rating, but can be worth considering since they are self-hosted and have very permissive licenses, making them mostly safe to run locally:\n\n\n\n\nSelf-hosted Stable Diffusion \n\n\n\nStable Diffusion is open-source model licensed under CreativeML Open RAIL-M License. Users have full access to the model and its code, can modify and redistribute it, given that it’s an on premise version. In Nextcloud, self-hosted Stable Diffusion can be used via LocalAI. We give it a Yellow rating, as the training data is not freely available in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhisper \n\n\n\nIn Nextcloud, you can use Whisper to enable speech-to-text conversion features. Whisper is available under the MIT License and has a Yellow rating due to limited availability of the training data.\n\n\n\n\n\nLlama 2 \n\n\n\nLlama 2 is a free LLM by Meta that can be run on premise, and the software for training and inference of this model is open source. However, the training data is not freely available. It is offered under Llama 2 Community License.\n\n\n\n\nWe don’t limit our users’ choice of AI tools, and there are other models and apps that you can integrate in Nextcloud Hub and use with Nextcloud Assistant, including self-hosted models like NeuralBeagle14 7B, Smaug-72B and Meta’s Llama 3. Or famous AI like ChatGPT, DALL·E or Aleph Alpha – which are far from meeting all the criteria of our rating, but you still can easily integrate them in Nextcloud if you wish. \n\n\n\nBuild your own private AI platform – with Nextcloud Hub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNextcloud Assistant is the first local AI assistant built into collaboration platform.
