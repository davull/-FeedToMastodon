<p>Home Assistant 2024.12! 🎄</p>
<p>Holidays are coming, and it is time for the last release of the year! 🎉</p>
<p><strong>2024</strong> has been a crazy year for Home Assistant. Not just in terms of features
like <a href="/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#sections-dashboard-no-longer-experimental">drag-and-drop dashboards</a>, <a href="/blog/2024/04/03/release-20244/#three-new-ways-to-organize">organization capabilities</a> like labels, and
the countless improvements to our voice efforts. But also the founding of
<a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">the Open Home Foundation</a>, and even more in the growth of our lovely community
as we’ve risen up to become <a href="/blog/2024/11/18/event-wrapup-github-universe-24/#we-are-number-1">the #1 open source project on GitHub</a>! ❤️</p>
<p>However, the year ain’t over yet! This month, we want to learn about all your
<em>“What the heck?!”</em> moments with Home Assistant. Tell us about any little
annoyances, bugs, ideas, or suggestions. You can read all about it in
<a href="/blog/2024/11/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/">the WTH announcement blog</a>, or join the conversation <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/month-of-what-the-heck/61">on our WTH forums</a>!</p>
<p>Honestly, <strong>the biggest announcement of the year has yet to come though</strong>… 🤫
I’m pretty sure it is voice hardware related. 😉 So make sure you aren’t
missing <a href="https://youtube.com/live/ZgoaoTpIhm8">the live stream on 19 December</a>! 📺 You will not be disappointed! 🎁</p>
<p>Before you check out everything in this release, I just want to close this
year with a big thank you to every single person in our community, which
includes you!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for using Home Assistant!</strong> ❤️</p>
<p>Happy holidays! And for the last time in 2024: Enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>Improved scene editor experience</h2>
<p><span class='terminology'>Scenes<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Scenes capture the states you want certain entities to be. For example, a scene can specify that light A should be turned on and light B should be bright red.<a class='terminology-link' href='/integrations/scene/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are a great way to set the mood in your home. They allow you
to capture the state of your devices at a specific moment and restore it
later, using a button on your dashboard, an automation, or even a voice command.</p>
<p>One of the common frustrations with editing scenes in Home Assistant is that it
would immediately activate and apply the scene if you opened the scene editor.
Not the best experience if you are doing some midnight tinkering and
accidentally activate a scene that turns on all the lights in the house,
waking up everyone. 😅</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/marcinbauer85">@marcinbauer85</a> to the rescue! 🦸‍♂️ As of this release, the scene
editor has two modes. A <strong>review mode</strong> and an <strong>edit mode</strong>.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="The improved scene editor now has a preview mode, which is shown in this screenshot." src="/images/blog/2024-12/scene-review-mode.png"/>
<p>The “review mode” is how your scene will open, and it will show you the scene as
it is currently set up, but it will not apply it. You can then switch to the
“edit mode”; only then will the scene activate, allowing you to adjust the
actual scenery and snapshot it again once you are happy with the changes.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you prefer <span class='terminology'>YAML<span class='terminology-tooltip'>YAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the <code>configuration.yaml</code> or <code>automations.yaml</code> files.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/yaml/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>, you can edit scenes directly from
the scene editor by selecting <strong>“Edit in YAML”</strong> from the three-dotted
<iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:dots-vertical' title='Dots vertical'></iconify-icon> overflow menu in the top right corner.</p>
<h2>Voice</h2>
<p>It has almost been two years since <a href="/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/">we started our journey</a> into building our
very own open source voice assistants, with the goal of letting users control
Home Assistant in their own language.</p>
<p>Today, we are getting even closer to the finish line. Not just with the features
that ship in this release, but you might have heard about our voice hardware
that is coming soon…</p>
<p>With some help from Santa 🎅 and his elves, we have prepared a product launch
YouTube live stream on 19 December 2024, at 20:00 GMT / 12:00 PT / 21:00 CET!</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="ZgoaoTpIhm8" videotitle="Product Launch 🗣️ Voice: Chapter 8"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>Curious? Be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgoaoTpIhm8">join the live stream</a>, hit like 👍, subscribe to our
channel, and the little bell 🔔 to get notified when we go live! You really
don’t want to miss this one!</p>
<p>But before we get there, let’s dive into the features that ship in this release!</p>
<h3>Let your voice assistant fall back to an LLM-based agent</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/">Exactly 6 months ago</a>, we bridged the gap between our default conversation agent
and the wonderful (and scary) world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model">LLMs</a>. We allowed you to experiment and
let an LLM-based conversation agent control your home instead of relying on our
built-in sentences.</p>
<p>This choice was an interesting first step. LLMs are generally much better at
interpreting natural language and more knowledgeable about the world than our
default agent. However, they are often slow and/or expensive. And let’s face it:
Even if the demos are cool, 90% of the commands we say in our homes are simple:
<em>“Turn this on”</em> or <em>“Turn that off”</em>.</p>
<p>Today, we’re finally allowing users to <strong>mix</strong> these worlds. Starting from this
release, you can set up a voice assistant that targets our fast,
community-driven conversation agent first and only falls back to an LLM-based
agent if no matches are found.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Dialog showing the Assist pipeline configuration, showing the new option to prefer handling commands locally." src="/images/blog/2024-12/llm-fallback-configuration.png"/>
<p>This allows you to mix the pros of both worlds with almost none of the cons.</p>
<p>Specific known commands will be processed locally and extremely fast, and the
power of an LLM will only be used for more complex queries that Home Assistant
does not natively understand.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="vThoxRIxHyI" videotitle="Let your voice assistant fall back to an LLM-based agent" posterquality="maxresdefault"></lite-youtube></p>
<h3>Language leaders are accelerating the pace</h3>
<p>It is no secret: our voice hardware will be revealed on 19 December 2024.
Language leaders have already got their hands on the device, and are working
extremely hard to polish support for their language.</p>
<p>The number of contributions to our <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/intents?tab=readme-ov-file">intents repository</a> (where we store the
supported sentences) skyrocketed during the last month, which we all truly
appreciate. More and more languages are becoming usable or even complete!
You can follow the progress <a href="https://home-assistant.github.io/intents/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We won’t list them all, but rest assured, someone is likely working hard to
ensure your native language works seamlessly, so you can use it comfortably
at home.</p>
<h3>A faster voice experience</h3>
<p>Our default conversation agent was built from the ground up to match a sentence
to its underlying intention extremely fast and on cheap hardware.</p>
<p>Release after release, we added more use cases and sentences to Home Assistant,
and our sentence-matching logic became slower and slower. In some languages,
a non-matching sentence could take more than 15 seconds to process!</p>
<p>This release adds a lot of love to this matching logic; we completely
reengineered the way we match sentences. On top of that, language leaders spent
some time reducing the complexity of their sentences. Some languages saw a 99%
reduction in the number of possible combinations!</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves:</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="RH69Dh6coMM" videotitle="A faster voice experience with our default conversation agent" posterquality="maxresdefault"></lite-youtube></p>
<h2>Revised Integration Quality Scale</h2>
<p>The Integration Quality Scale (IQS) is a way we classify the “quality” of an
integration. It gives users an idea of what to expect from an integration.
You might have noticed our IQS indicator listed on
<a href="/integrations/homewizard">each integration documentation page</a>.</p>
<p>The scale was initially introduced in 2018 and aimed more at the technical
side and code of an integration back then. Over the years, it didn’t
really evolve with the rest of Home Assistant and the general expectations of
our community. It was time for a change!</p>
<p>Over the last few months, we have worked with the community to revise and
improve the scale. Involving not just our community developers but also
documentation writers, user experience designers, and anyone interested
in the community.</p>
<p>As a result, the new Integration Quality Scale is not just focused on the code
but even more on the overall user experience. It is now a more holistic view
of the integration, and we hope it will help everyone make better decisions
about what to use in their homes.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="The integration quality scale is also shown in the Home Assistant UI now. The image shows the HomeWizard Energy integration scoring platinum on the new integration quality scale." src="/images/blog/2024-12/integration-quality-scale.png" />
<p>We now have a total of 4 scaled tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>🥉 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-bronze">Bronze</a></strong>:
The new minimum set of requirements we’ve set for new integrations.</li>
<li><strong>🥈 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-silver">Silver</a></strong>:
Ensuring reliability and robustness of integrations.</li>
<li><strong>🥇 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-gold">Gold</a></strong>:
Ensuring a gold standard user experience, including documentation.</li>
<li><strong>🏆 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-platinum">Platinum</a></strong>:
The epitome of quality, supreme code quality, and optimal performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have four additional (non-scaled) special tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>❓ <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-no-score">No score</a></strong>:
For integrations that are not yet scored against the new scale.</li>
<li><strong>🏠 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-internal">Internal</a></strong>
For integrations Home Assistant itself uses, like the automation engine.</li>
<li><strong>💾 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-legacy">Legacy</a></strong>
For older integrations that can’t be set up through the UI.</li>
<li><strong>📦 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-custom">Custom</a></strong>
For custom integrations, as we can’t score those.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read all about these tiers, what they have been designed for, and a
summary of their characteristics on our dedicated
<a href="/docs/quality_scale/">Integration Quality Scale page</a>.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope this new scale will not just help our users, but also our
community developers to understand what is expected by providing a clear path
to improving their integrations. To help with that, we have now
<a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/#integration-quality-scale-rules">extensively documented every rule and requirement for each tier in our
developer documentation</a>.</p>

you will now actually see the parsing error message in the UI. This is really
helpful! Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Translations for units of measurement</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, we have been working hard to make every little
bit of Home Assistant accessible for everyone by providing translations
for every part of the system. 🌐</p>
<p>However, we still have some edge cases, where we are not able to provide
translations for everything. One of those edge cases is the units of
measurement. 📏</p>
<p>Although units do not need translation (like <code>°C</code> or <code>kWh</code>) in most cases, many
sensors in a home might use specific and non-standardized units. For example,
a sensor that measures the number of “people” in a home or one that tells you
how many “movies” are in your collection.</p>
<p>So, suppose you now have a sensor with a custom measurement unit, like the
amount of “movies” in your collection. In that case, integrations can now
provide translations for those units. 🎉</p>
<p>Several integrations have already added translations for their units, including
<a href="/integrations/jellyfin">Jellyfin</a>, <a href="/integrations/squeezebox">Lyrion Music Server</a>, <a href="/integrations/transmission">Transmission</a>, <a href="/integrations/pi_hole">Pi-hole</a>, <a href="/integrations/qbittorrent">QBitTorrent</a>,
<a href="/integrations/nextdns">NextDNS</a>, <a href="/integrations/mastodon">Mastodon</a>, and <a href="/integrations/mealie">Mealie</a>!</p>
<h2>We’ve upgraded to Python 3.13</h2>
<center><img class="no-shadow" style="width: 65%" alt="The Python logo; Home Assistant now runs on top of Python latest 3.13 update" src="/images/blog/2024-12/python.png"/></center>
<p>This release comes packaged with Python 3.13!  🐍</p>
<p>Wondering what that means? Python is the programming language that powers Home
Assistant behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? Every new Python release brings improvements that we can
tap into—better performance, fewer bugs, and a smoother developer experience
for our contributors. Plus, Python 3.13 offers a speed boost to Home Assistant
overall—what’s not to love? 🚀</p>
<p>Running Home Assistant OS or using the Home Assistant Container? No sweat—we’ve
got you covered. The upgrade to Python 3.13 is handled automatically. Just
update Home Assistant as usual, and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Easy, right? 😎</p>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.12 in December.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

<h2>Backward-incompatible changes</h2>
<p>We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.</p>
<p>We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:</p>

definitively known time-based recorded data.</p>
<p>Prior to this change, if the start of the time window was earlier than the
oldest datapoint in the recorder, <code>history_stats</code> would count time using the
assumption that an entity was in the first state it found since the beginning
of time. This could lead to wild overcalculations when a switch was turned on
after a long period of inactivity, and <code>history_stats</code> would assume it had
<em>always</em> been on and calculate a huge value based on that.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: For all of December 🎄, we are opening up to share any issue, idea,
suggestion, or annoyance you have with Home Assistant
<a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/month-of-what-the-heck/61">on our community forums</a>!</p>
<h2>Welcome to the month of “What the heck?!”: Third edition</h2>
<p><strong>It’s back!</strong> 🎉 We are thrilled to announce the <strong>third</strong> edition of the month
of “What the heck?!” (WTH for short). Every <a href="/blog/2020/08/18/the-month-of-what-the-heck/">two</a> <a href="/blog/2022/09/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/">years</a>, we take the time to
pause, listen, and dive deep into the little things that maybe you go
<em>“What the heck?!”</em> about Home Assistant.</p>
<p>We’ve been <a href="https://analytics.home-assistant.io/">growing really hard for years now</a> with over a million
Home Assistant-powered smart homes out there, and, as of this year, we are also
<a href="/blog/2024/11/18/event-wrapup-github-universe-24/#we-are-number-1">the #1 open source project on GitHub</a>!</p>
<p>A lot has happened since <a href="/blog/2022/09/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/">the last edition two years ago</a>. Lots of effort went
into making a <a href="/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/">voice-controlled Home Assistant</a> a reality. We have implemented
<a href="/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#sections-dashboard-no-longer-experimental">new dashboards and cards</a> (with drag-and-drop!),
<a href="/blog/2024/04/03/release-20244/#three-new-ways-to-organize">added organization capabilities</a> with labels and categories, and so <a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#dipping-our-toes-in-the-world-of-ai-using-llms">much</a>
<a href="/blog/2023/11/01/release-202311/#there-is-a-lot-to-do">more</a>! But did everything turn out the way it should? Did we miss things?
Or, worse, did something start to annoy you?</p>
<p>That is what this month is about! This year, we are kicking it off in the month
of <strong>December</strong> as a nice closing activity for this year, and we can’t wait to
hear from 👉 <strong>YOU</strong> 👈!</p>
<h3>Lowering the barrier for sharing WTH?! moments</h3>
<p>We realize reporting bugs on our <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/new/choose">GitHub</a> might be a steep hill and, for some,
maybe even a bit scary. You need a GitHub account to report an issue following
issue templates and forms, and the report itself needs to be written in a way
that a developer can work with. Above all, we use our issue tracker to track
actual issues and bugs, not small feature requests or annoyances.</p>
<p>While this is a common and reasonable process to collect, track, and process
bugs, our issue tracking-process might not be the ideal way to learn about your
<em>“What the heck?!”</em> moments, small tweaks, and improvements that can make us
all enjoy Home Assistant even more.</p>
<p>Today, we have opened up a <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/month-of-what-the-heck/61">Community Forum category</a> as a safe, lower-barrier
place to talk about your Home Assistant “What the heck?!” moments.
More importantly: discuss and vote on topics your fellow home automators have
brought up.</p>
<h2>What are we looking for?</h2>
<p>Just as with previous editions, I sent out a related question on my socials
earlier this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🎅 𝘚𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘢 𝘮𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 𝘣𝘦 𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨… If you could ask for one small Home Assistant
improvement this holiday season, what would it be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answers to this question pretty much capture the goal behind this month:
Finding those nice quality-of-life features and little annoyances, highlighting
inconsistencies, suggestions for things that could be streamlined more, and even
big-ticket items. All of those things would make Home Assistant even more
awesome for everyone.</p>
<p>I’ve received many responses on these social media posts on <a href="https://x.com/Frenck/status/1861823068735181154">X</a>, <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@frenck/113556074335097996">Mastodon</a>,
and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ofidofdlypuxb2dlfdmbh3a3/post/3lbx2w2kh5a2p">Bluesky</a>. Most of the responses there are <strong>exactly</strong> what we are looking
for this month. I’ve picked a few from these platforms to show you what I mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>Makes exposing entities to HomeKit the same as to Alexa &amp; Google</em>” (<a href="https://x.com/peterjvandoorn/status/1861898354038292579">Peter Hardy-vanDoorn</a>)</li>
<li><em>“Polygon zones would be so very helpful instead of just the base circle”</em> (<a href="https://x.com/KrispKiwi/status/1861825026825265406">KrispKiwi</a>)</li>
<li>“<em>Edit a scene without activating it. I can only edit my sleep scene after everyone goes to sleep or in YAML.”</em> (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/codebuild21.bsky.social/post/3lbx72g4l6s2n">codebuild21</a>)</li>
<li><em>“The possibility of catching errors in automations and being able to take actions when they occur 🙂”</em> (<a href="https://x.com/sermayoral/status/1862109088139583917">Sergio Mayoral</a>)</li>
<li><em>“Not Fancy! Better backup management, especially pruning options!”</em> (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aaposutry.bsky.social/post/3lby3xqhzzk2w">Alex Alami</a>)</li>
<li><em>“Persist my prefered dashboard across my different devices/browsers.”</em> (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chayotejarocho.space/post/3lbx7yorfms2c">Carlos Sánchez López</a>)</li>
<li><em>“Home Assistant voice hardware!”</em> (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paulusschoutsen.nl/post/3lbx32dabes2s">Paulus Schoutsen</a>) 😆</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all great topics for the month of “What the heck?!”, I hope they inspire you for more topics to share 💖.</p>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>As you might be aware, we also create and publish a bigger, high level, roadmap
for the greater direction of Home Assistant. A few weeks back, <a href="https://github.com/madelena">Madelena</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/jlpouffier">JLo</a> shared the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/11/15/roadmap-2024h2/">2024 Year-end update of our roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>This year’s month of “What the heck?!” is thus different in this regard, as in
previous editions we didn’t have any roadmap in place. For this year’s WTH,
the product team will also be watching for items that will help shape and
prioritize our roadmap for the near future.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, many items on this year’s roadmap that we’ve worked on
have their origins or have been shaped by topics from the previous WTH from
2022. For example, the <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/why-are-all-automations-in-one-big-list/467153?u=frenck">ability to organize automations</a> and the ability to
<a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-cant-we-drag-drop-in-the-dashboard/467205?u=frenck">drag-and-drop cards on your dashboards</a>.</p>
<h2>Why December?</h2>
<p>In the previous editions, we had this month in October; this year, we decided to
move it to December. We figured, the holiday season is perfect for this event. 🎄</p>
<p>Many of us have a bit more time on our hands during the holidays, whether that’s
tinkering with automations, exploring our new dashboards, contributing to our
project, or simply enjoying engaging our active and vibrant community.</p>
<h2>Start sharing your WTH!</h2>
<p>👆That title says it all really. Start sharing <strong>your</strong> “What the heck?!”
moment, browse through all the WTH moments others brought up, and vote for the
ones you feel the same about.</p>
<p>We are excited about this month and looking forward to everything brought up!</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/month-of-what-the-heck/61">Join us on the forums!</a></strong>, or read the <strong><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></strong> below.</p>

So, when does Home Assistant trigger this moment for you?
</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“Great! I have multiple things! Should I put all my stuff in a single
topic?!”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>No</strong>, please create <strong>multiple</strong>, <strong>smaller</strong> topics. There is no limitation
on how many forum topics one can create for WTH. Each topic can be voted on,
picked up, and maybe even resolved. Also, having multiple things stacked in
a single forum topic makes resolving, discussing, and voting on them hard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“Is everything reported going to be fixed/addressed?”</em></strong></p>
<p>Sorry, but the answer here is <strong>no</strong>; there is no guarantee that it will
happen. The goal is to lower the barrier reporting things for one month.
Code contributors will definitely join the effort and address a few of the
listed things. Still, in the end, the number of submissions in WTH is,
in general, simply too much to address. However, we have picked up a lot of
items over the years (including bigger topics); it helps us shape our roadmap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><a name='no-new-integrations'></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“I really want this new integration or add-on to be implemented, so I can
use my devices. Is this the right place for it?”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>No</strong>, this event is <strong>not</strong> for requesting new add-ons or device/services
integrations. Please use the “<a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/feature-requests/13">Feature Requests</a>” forum category instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“My WTH topic is one of the top-voted ones, so it is going to be
fixed/addressed, right?”</em></strong></p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a contest. Voting will help with visibility and give a sense
of the suggestion’s impact. However, it might be difficult or too big to
implement. A topic with lots of votes is more likely to be noticed by a
contributor, but it is not guaranteed to be picked up.</p>
<p>Topics with a lot of engagement, of course, help us shape our future roadmap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“I’ve found a bug and am comfortable with GitHub. Where should I report my
issue now?”</em></strong></p>
<p>If you are comfortable using GitHub, please, by all means,
<a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/new/choose">file an issue report on GitHub</a> instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <link href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/11/27/home-assistant-yellow-gets-cm5-support/"/>
    <updated>2024-11-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/11/27/home-assistant-yellow-gets-cm5-support</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-cm5/art.jpg' alt="Home Assistant Yellow in all its glory">
<p>We launched our <a href="/yellow/">Home Assistant Yellow</a> over two years ago, with the design philosophy that it would grow and extend its capabilities with its users’ needs. Need more storage, add an NVMe drive. Need Matter over Thread instead of Zigbee, change the firmware.</p>
<p>Thanks to Raspberry Pi providing us with an early sample, we have been able to add <strong>Compute Module 5 (CM5) compatibility to the Home Assistant Yellow</strong>, which will be included in Home Assistant OS 14 (along with some <a href="#other-additions-to-haos-14">other hardware support</a>). This gives current and future users a great option to get more performance if they need it, but we must say that CM4 is still more than enough for most Home Assistant users’ needs.</p>
<p>As part of the Open Home Foundation, we fight for privacy, choice, and sustainability in the smart home. The Yellow achieves all three, and this announcement only improves the choices available and long-term sustainability.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Using Compute Modules</h2>
<p>When designing Yellow to give our users the ability to expand the capabilities of the device we chose Raspberry Pi’s Compute Module platform. It allows users to increase the RAM, add eMMC, built-in Bluetooth, or even get more speed 😉 - without having to replace the Yellow - all you need to do is get a new module. This is also great for the repairability of the product over its lifetime.</p>
<p>Though it was designed for the Compute Module 4 (CM4), we always hoped it would be compatible with its future successors. Over the past couple of months, we’ve been updating firmware and testing early hardware, and it is indeed compatible. Due to changes on CM5, the installation method is slightly more complex than it was on CM4, which is detailed below.</p>
<h2>What CM5 could bring</h2>
<p>I must admit, it is fun to play with the latest and greatest hardware (while also finding new uses for the hardware it replaces - old Pi products make great <a href="https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-satellite">Wyoming satellites</a>). In most use cases, such as running automations or connecting an average home’s worth of devices, the majority of users will not notice any difference between a Green, CM4, or CM5.</p>
<p>For certain power user needs CM5 might provide big improvements. Some Pi 5 users have seen nearly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaVND-M9pkA&amp;t=415s">3x improvements</a> in ESPHome compilation times; saving a minute or two per device can really add up in big deployments. Another area where CM5 can excel over CM4 is running local speech-to-text processing if you’re using <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a> fully locally.</p>
<h2>Installing on CM5</h2>
<p>For the Home Assistant Yellow, we have <a href="https://yellow.home-assistant.io/guides/reinstall-os/">two ways to install Home Assistant OS</a> onto the Compute Module. One is very easy and quick (using USB 2.0), while the other is more complex (using rpiboot). Unfortunately, due to firmware differences with CM5 it cannot boot off USB 2.0 devices (though the USB 2.0 ports work once the device is booted).</p>
<p>If you already have a Yellow running Home Assistant OS, upgrading to CM5 can be a drop-in replacement, but in some circumstances it can be more complex,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CM4 Lite (no eMMC) with NVMe storage</strong> - Update to the latest HAOS (version 14.0 or greater - as of writing 14.0 is still pre-release, we recommend you wait for the stable release, but if you want to get the pre-release today either <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os/#running-a-beta-version">join the beta channel</a> or <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os/#running-a-specific-version">explicitly install</a> <code>14.0.rc2</code>), power it down, swap the CM4 Lite for a CM5 Lite, and you’re good to go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CM4 with eMMC (regardless if you are using NVMe or not)</strong> -  Download a backup of your Home Assistant, power down your system, and install Home Assistant OS on the CM5 using <a href="https://yellow.home-assistant.io/guides/reinstall-os/#:~:text=Option%202%3A%20Reinstall%20Home%20Assistant%20OS%20using%20rpiboot">rpiboot</a> (the more complex installation method). Once installed restore the backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Yellow with CM5</strong>: You will need to install Home Assistant with <a href="https://yellow.home-assistant.io/guides/reinstall-os/#:~:text=Option%202%3A%20Reinstall%20Home%20Assistant%20OS%20using%20rpiboot">rpiboot</a> (the more complex installation method).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For full details on how to set up your Home Assistant Yellow <a href="https://yellow.home-assistant.io/">visit our documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>CM4 is still great</h2>
<p>If you have, or were looking at getting, a Home Assistant <a href="/green/">Green</a> or <a href="/yellow/">Yellow</a> with a CM4, both are more than capable. A third of all Home Assistant users are using Pi 4 class hardware.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-cm5/analytics.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="In our analytics Pi 4 class hardware is the most used SBC">
<p>In fact, according to our <a href="https://analytics.home-assistant.io/">opt-in analytics</a>, more people are using Pi 3 hardware than Pi 5 hardware (granted the Pi 5 has only had official support since <a href="/blog/2024/02/26/home-assistant-os-12-support-for-raspberry-pi-5/">February this year</a>). Home Assistant continues to get updates that improve its speed on all hardware, most recently <a href="/blog/2024/02/26/home-assistant-os-12-support-for-raspberry-pi-5/#faster-backups">faster backups</a> and <a href="/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#home-assistant-boots-twice-as-fast">reboots</a>. This allows people to keep hardware running longer, and in the end that is our goal 🌎.</p>
<p>CM4 is not only powerful enough for most users, it also has a long life ahead of it. Raspberry Pi has even confirmed that they will <strong>fully support CM4 <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000#:~:text=Obsolescence%20Statement">until 2034</a>💪,</strong> and will continue to manufacture them.</p>
<h2>Other additions to HAOS 14</h2>
<p>On the topic of newly supported hardware, our release of Home Assistant OS 14 will bring support not only for CM5 but also for the Hailo-8 AI accelerator. This is the AI accelerator found in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/ai-kit.html">Raspberry Pi AI Kit</a> or the even more powerful Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-ai-hat/">released</a> last month, which is exclusively for the Raspberry Pi 5. For those using a Pi 5 they can now offload AI processing, like object or person detection, to this efficient add-on.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We’re incredibly proud that, all this time later, the Home Assistant Yellow continues to be one of the best options for power users. We are excited to see how our users take advantage of CM5, and it’s great to see CM4 continue to be a great option with long-term support.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/art.jpg' alt="Event Wrap-up">
<p>In case you missed it, we had a pretty huge presence at this year’s <a href="https://githubuniverse.com/">GitHub Universe</a>, their global annual developer conference. 2024 was the culmination of many years of our community growing, and there were some really big moments—our community meetup in San Francisco, awards, rising in GitHub’s rankings, and being a part of the event’s Day 2 keynote.</p>
<p>After a few years of being in 2nd place, we are now the #1 open source project on GitHub with over 21,000 contributors helping build Home Assistant. We also won the Wonderfully Welcoming award for being the 2nd most active project for <em>new</em> contributors. This is really just scratching the surface of the week we spent together in San Francisco, and I (<a href="https://github.com/missyquarry">Missy Quarry</a>, your Community &amp; Social Media Manager) would like to share the highlights with everyone who couldn’t make it this year.</p>

<h2>Community comes together</h2>
<p>What started as a simple request to attend the event tumbled into not only being a part of the Day 2 Keynote of GitHub Universe ❗❗ but being offered a venue at GitHub HQ for a community meetup. It picked up from there - interviews, speaking on panels, and after-parties - this 2-day event spun into a 7-day trip to San Francisco. Not only was this my first event as a part of an open source project, but it was also my first time meeting <a href="https://github.com/balloob">Paulus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frenck">Frenck</a> in person. Paulus is taller than I expected 😅 and Frenck has legs! 😱</p>
<p>While there is a lot of good news for us that came out of GitHub Universe (and I <em>will</em> get to that), I would be a poor community manager if I didn’t start this out with the first in-person meetup I coordinated for Home Assistant. 😌</p>
<p>I knew immediately that I needed custom swag for the event, and got to work with our Graphic Artist, Clelia. We wanted to make sure it was connected to where we were holding the meetup and that it was collectible - we landed on postcards and pins in the shape of stamps.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/postcard-badge.png' alt="postcard and badge">Limited edition San Fran postcard and badge</p>
<p>And, of course, you can’t go to an event without stickers, so we took our Home Assistant and ESPHome logos with an Open Home Foundation badge and made holographic stickers. ✨</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/shiny.png' alt="our shiny stickers" style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'>
<p>The event itself ended up being a small gathering, but it was filled with amazing connections and conversations. Paulus and Frenck talked for over an hour about the status of Home Assistant and what we’re working on right now, then took questions from the community members. It was great talking to everyone who attended - being able to bring people from different aspects of life together energizes me, and I am excited to plan whatever the next meetup will be. 👀</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/meetup-audience.jpg' alt="Universe meetup ahead of the event at GitHub HQ"></p>
<h2>We are number 1!</h2>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/number-1.png' alt="We are number one"></p>
<p>It was an honor just for Home Assistant to be asked to speak at the Day 2 Keynote; what we <em>didn’t</em> know when we started this ride was that the keynote would announce something new: <strong>we are the #1 open source project on GitHub</strong> by active contributors!! 🎉 Not only that, on the rankings for first-time contributors, we moved up to 2nd place, and an Open Home Foundation collaboration partner, <a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/">Zigbee2MQTT</a>, is also now in the top 10! 🥳 This is all featured in the <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/">GitHub Octoverse 2024 report</a>, which is a really interesting read.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/octoverse-contributors.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="top five projects by contributors - source GitHub Octoverse 2024 report">
<p>Our friends at GitHub did a great job of making sure we were surprised by this news—and believe me when I say we lost our collective minds when they revealed it to us. 😎 We also found out that we’ve won GitHub’s <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/celebrating-the-github-awards-2024-recipients/#wonderfully-welcoming-award">Wonderfully Welcoming Award</a>, which recognizes how we attract and support new contributors to our project.</p>

<h2>Open Source - ⭐️ of the show</h2>
<p>Paulus and Frenck were at keynote rehearsals Friday, Sunday, and Monday to be prepared for Wednesday. So I picked up my badge Monday morning, which was a hackable board with an e-ink display programmed to show our names - the little details they put into this event were quite pleasing. 🤩</p>
<p>There was a community session where GitHub showed off a little of what they would reveal on Day 2. At the breakout session, I was able to share our pain points about moderating a community directly on GitHub, and it was good to hear how other projects do this on the platform.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/day-1-keynote.jpg' alt="Paulus, Frenck and myself at the Day 1 keynote">Paulus, Frenck and myself at the Day 1 keynote</p>
<p>Day 1 is when we had our booth in the <a href="https://github.blog/open-source/10-projects-in-the-open-source-zone-at-github-universe-2024/">Open Source Zone</a>, but I was also set to represent Home Assistant at a panel. The session was called <a href="https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe24/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog/session/1715376172449001OEqW">Cha-ching! How to attract funding for your open source projects</a>; I was very excited to tell our story since Home Assistant is funded by y’all - the community - through our <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud subscription</a>, and not investors. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that others on the panel shared our approach to building a sustainable project through community support! I had great conversations with several people working on other open source projects like Homebrew and Ladybird.</p>
<p>Our booth was a great success, and we had so many members of the community come up to us to let us know how much they love Home Assistant, along with some people who had never heard of us curious to learn more. We were surprised to hear that some people had not yet tried the <a href="/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#sections-dashboard-no-longer-experimental">new Sections dashboard</a>, which we were demoing at the booth. It was really useful to get this feedback in person. All of them took stickers. 😆</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/booth.jpg' alt="Our booth in the Open Source Zone">Our booth in the <a href="https://github.blog/open-source/10-projects-in-the-open-source-zone-at-github-universe-2024/">Open Source Zone</a></p>
<p>Day 2 was when Paulus and Frenck took the stage, and I got there early to ensure I got a good seat up front. We had not only a good crowd in person, but <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">Joost</a> hosted a watch party on the Community Stage in <a href="/join-chat">our Discord server</a>!</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/ha-keynote.jpg' alt="Frenck and Paulus on the keynote stage representing Home Assistant">Their final message to the crowd - <i>what are you going to build?</i></p>
<p>The guys did amazing up on stage! 🤩 It was wonderful to see Paulus explain why Home Assistant was built and how it connects to GitHub’s ambitious goal of 1 billion developers. Frenck shared not only what we’ve done to grow the largest open community on GitHub, but also how the community collectively shapes the project’s direction. <a href="https://github.com/kdaigle">Kyle Daigle</a>, a fellow Home Assistant user and GitHub COO, joined Frenck and Paulus on stage and did a really fun Home Assistant live demo. Paulus also shared how he secured the future of the project by giving it to the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, and its mission to bring privacy, choice, and sustainability to the smart home. Catch their segment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh9A4LvuGHM&amp;t=679s">here</a>, but I would recommend watching the entire keynote - GitHub is doing good stuff for new developers. 😌</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="uh9A4LvuGHM" videoStartAt="679" videotitle="GitHub Universe Day 2 Keynote - featuring Home Assistant"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>After the keynote, Paulus and Frenck both did interviews, and even gave away an extra Home Assistant Green we brought to the guest speaker representing <a href="https://github.com/hackclub">Hack Club</a>. We spent the rest of the day on the show floor, meeting more of the community and enjoying all the fun.</p>
<h2>Connecting with the community</h2>
<p>It was an amazing event, and so nice to meet my colleagues Paulus and Frenck after months of working with them remotely. Most of all, it was great to meet the community, get feedback and hear how Home Assistant improves their lives. Thanks to everyone who took the time to talk to us! 🥰</p>
<p>GitHub was an incredible host, and it was nice to give something back to them after so many years of support they have given this project. At Universe, they gave us a platform to explain how important our community is and how your support has kept Home Assistant thriving and continuously growing - becoming the top open source project on the platform. The next time you see a blog from me should be when I announce Home Assistant Community Day. 😌</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> We are making great progress on our roadmap, and moving forward onto the next priorities on the roadmap. 🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃</p>
<p>As <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-introduction/">we had previously mentioned</a>, the goal of the roadmap is to provide a North Star for all of our product initiatives to follow in a coherent and consistent direction. At the <a href="/blog/2024/04/24/state-of-the-open-home-2024/">State of the Open Home</a> in April this year, we introduced to our community <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/">our first roadmap</a>. We intend to keep our community informed every half year, and this is our first update to our public roadmap.</p>
<p>We are happy to report that we have made good progress on the product initiatives on our roadmap so far, thanks to our core maintainers along with the help of the team at <a href="https://nabucasa.com">Nabu Casa</a>, the commercial partner of the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org">Open Home Foundation</a>. Most of the product initiatives in the 2024 roadmap have matured according to plan, and now the team has begun to focus on the ones that we had planned for next.</p>

<h2>Home Assistant: “A Home-Approved Smart Home”</h2>
<p>The theme of the Home Assistant roadmap is to improve the <a href="https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/open-home-approval-factor/">Home Approval Factor</a> of our platform, ensuring the adoption of Home Assistant by other household members within a smart home.</p>
<p>This can be done by improving the touchpoints that all members of the household will interact with, such as <a href="#automations">automations</a>, <a href="#dashboards">dashboards</a>, and <a href="#voice-assistants">voice assistants</a>, while maintaining the power and depth of the platform for our power users and admins. Our plan is categorized into the following product areas:</p>
<h3>Automations</h3>
<h4>In good shape: Make automations easier to organize</h4>
<p>For a long time, the ability to organize automation was at the top of our feature requests. Therefore, organizing automations was our first focus on the automation product area.</p>
<p>We gave users the ability to categorize automations, which makes the process of managing, editing, debugging, and searching automations much simpler. The categories are up to the users to define. For instance, I personally created categories per functionality such as “Smart Heating” or “Smart Cleaning”, and I particularly like my “Tests” categories where I keep all the automations that are currently being tested in my home.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-04/filter-panel.png" alt="Screenshot of Automations settings with filter panel" /></p>
<p>On top of categories, users can now attach labels to automations, just like any other entity found in Home Assistant. Labels can be used to filter the automation list further, but what I am most interested in is the automation capabilities of the labels themselves. I saw some great ideas in the community, one of them that struck me was the idea to label some automation as “Not Guest Friendly” and deactivate them when a guest mode was activated. It’s nice to see labels as a tool to automate everything, even your automations themselves. 😀</p>
<p>All in all, Home Assistant truly made automations easier to organize in the past 6 months. We could still work on that, no opportunity is ever really done, but for the time being, we are considering this one done so that we can focus on bigger problems.</p>
<h4>Newly in progress: Make automations easier to create</h4>
<p>Automations are one of the cornerstones of Home Assistant, but it’s not an easy task to create them, especially if you are just starting out. There are a dozen things to know before you start and a dozen things to learn along the way.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-01/add-action-search.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new add action dialog utilizing the search function to find whatever you need.">
<p>Last year we redesigned our action picker and replaced a single option with an obscure name, <strong>“Call Service”</strong>, with hundreds of neatly categorized entries that we called <strong>“Actions”</strong>. This improved the automation creation process by quite a margin.</p>
<p>Today, the automation editor feels like it has progressed at two different speeds; our actions are easy to use, but our triggers and conditions are not. So we have begun bringing the same level of convenience that we previously brought to actions to our beloved triggers and conditions.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make our automation editor more approachable without losing what makes us unique: Its capabilities.</p>
<h4>Later priority: Make blueprints easier to use</h4>
<p>Blueprints are amazing, they represent what makes the Home Assistant community truly great: Sharing what you learned with others.</p>
<p>We are aware that using (and sharing) blueprints is not the most straightforward process today. For now, this is the next opportunity we want to tackle inside the automation stream.</p>
<h3>Dashboards</h3>
<h4>In good shape: Make customization of dashboards easy and intuitive</h4>
<p>With the stable release of the new Sections view layout in Home Assistant <a href="/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/">2024.11</a>, our work on making customization of dashboards easier is now in good shape! The learning curve for creating nice dashboards has been vastly reduced, and we are seeing more and more people being interested in and being able to create high-quality dashboards that are usable for everyone in the household.</p>
<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections" src="/images/blog/2024-11/dashboard-conversion.png"/>Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections</p>
<p>Work will continue with the dashboard working group. The group is currently looking into standardizing the appearance of our default cards. <strong>Please <a href="/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/#process-how-can-we-work-together">reach out to us</a> if you are a frontend developer</strong> who would like to contribute and be part of the journey!</p>
<h4>Newly in progress: Make default dashboards more useful and relevant</h4>
<p>Now that we’ve made customization of dashboards easier than ever, what’s next? We understand that it can be intimidating for users when they are faced with a blank slate. Some may be full of ideas on how they would like to fill their dashboards up, but some would prefer if Home Assistant came with something useful out-of-the-box. Therefore, we are now looking into making dashboards easier, even if you don’t know how to create one.</p>
<p class='img'><img alt="Case studies of many dashboards of our users" src="/images/blog/2024-11-roadmap-2024h2/dashboard-casestudies.png"/>Case studies of many dashboards of our users</p>
<p>Over the past year, we have looked into dozens of case studies - dashboards created by many of you, from the most popular to the most pragmatic - and began to notice patterns in how our users organize their dashboards. Home Assistant is unique compared to other smart home platforms in that our dashboards are not just about controlling devices. After all, the perfect app is no app, as in, opening an app to control your light bulb is less convenient than simply flicking a light switch, or better yet, just automating it.</p>
<p>What we see our users have built instead are dashboards that help them keep track of information for their daily lives at a glance, and keep a birds-eye view of everything that is going on around their homes. For example, while you can automate Home Assistant to notify you when energy usage is too high, or you can ask Assist the current power usage, our dashboards shine at data visualization and its ability to tell you lots of information you need by just glancing at it.</p>
<p>Currently, our default dashboard simply dumps every single entity that a home has onto one page, making it wildly unmanageable as the smart home grows. While it can automatically group entities by areas, we have learned that areas are not the only way users look at their dashboard information. What we saw instead are dashboards that are specialized and focused on the functions of a home, such as energy usage, security and safety, and network status, on complex objects, such as a car and a 3D printer, or on information unrelated to the home itself, such as weather, neighborhood information, or even rocket launches. While we can simply show every entity by domain, we know we can make these function-focused dashboards much more useful by exposing insights by curating and juxtaposing information.</p>
<h4>Next priority: Improve privacy in user, guest, and public access</h4>
<p>The inability to fine-tune access to Home Assistant by guests or other members of the family has been a pain point requested by many of our users. We want to investigate ways to mitigate this while improving the privacy of the household. Our research on what privacy means to users will hopefully bring more clarity to this before we start working on it.</p>
<h3>Voice Assistants</h3>
<h4>In good shape: Improve Assist capabilities out of the box</h4>
<p>Assist, our private voice assistant, received a lot of love over the last 6 months. Our first focus was to improve its capabilities out of the box, without needing to tinker with it. We added a lot of features that were heavily requested by the community, features that bring us one step closer to feature parity with our non-private competitors.</p>
<p>We brought area awareness, which allows you to target devices in the same area without mentioning the area (like “Close the curtains” or “Turn off the lights”). We brought floor support, which allows you to target devices across areas on the same floor; very useful for homes with an open floor design (for example “Turn on all lights on the first floor”).</p>
<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid="v3mNdTsX4J0" videotitle="Voice timers with countdown text and loading bar"></lite-youtube>Timers running on an S3 Box, with countdown text and a loading bar!</p>
<p>We implemented timers, allowing any voice assistant device to “ring” when a timer ends, including supporting the creation of multiple timers. You can also pause and resume them and add or remove time from them. You can combine commands with timers by giving a delayed command, allowing you to perform an action after a specific amount of time (like “Turn off the TV in 30 minutes)”.</p>
<p>We also brought the ability to control media via voice. Pausing or resuming them, controlling the volume, and going to the next track. This, combined with the area awareness capability mentioned above made for some really interesting short commands that work in a room with a TV playing or music streaming, such as “Pause”, “Resume” and “Next”.</p>
<p>Finally, our on-device wake word engine called microWakeWord became much faster and much better at recognizing wake words. This is the result of using real voice data in the training process to fine-tune the models. With <a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/">Wake Word Collective</a>, you can now contribute by lending your voice to improve our community-driven, privacy-focused voice assistant! You can read more about it in <a href="/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/">this blog post</a>.</p>
<h4>In progress: Make Assist easier to start with</h4>
<p>So Assist is more capable, but what about getting started with Voice?</p>
<p>Voice is hard because it is a combination of great software and great hardware. Up until recently, we primarily focused on making the software experience great and relied on readily available hardware to power our voice assistants.</p>
<p class='img'><img alt="A teaser of our voice hardware" src="/images/blog/2024-11-roadmap-2024h2/voice-hardware-teaser.jpg"/>A teaser of our voice hardware</p>
<p>However, this is changing - over the past 6 months, we have built our own hardware! It will be the first voice assistant hardware built from the ground up to work with Home Assistant, fully open source (firmware and hardware), and it is going to be released <em>very soon</em>. It is truly the missing hardware piece to a more approachable voice experience in Home Assistant, and we cannot wait to see what you will build with it.</p>
<h4>Later priority: Make Assist more conversational</h4>
<p>The more functionality we add to Assist, the more we reach its transactional limitations. Indeed, today, an interaction is one way, from a user (issuing a command) to Assist (acting on that command). We would like to improve this, allowing more conversational interactions with Assist.</p>
<p>In the future, Assist will be able to ask for clarifications before fulfilling a command, such as requesting the duration of a timer if it was not part of the original command or asking for confirmation before processing critical actions, such as unlocking all doors. On top of that, we would like to allow the conversation to start from Assist, and not from the user, such as greeting someone when they enter a room.
This pairs very well with LLM-based conversation agents due to their ability to retain context, but we will make sure these types of complex interactions are also possible with our default conversation agent.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<h4>In good shape: Build local LLM infrastructure</h4>
<p>In the past six months, we’ve introduced support for LLM local tools and <a href="/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#control-home-assistant-using-ai-with-ollama">Ollama</a>, pushing our efforts to make AI more accessible and private for experimentation within Home Assistant. We’ve also dedicated significant effort to creating realistic benchmarks, focusing on natural, conversational use cases rather than edge cases. This approach lets us better understand performance and user experience in day-to-day interactions.</p>
<p>Our latest benchmark for local language models (LLMs) can be explored <a href="https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports">here</a>, showcasing how models like qwen2.5 perform in realistic settings. With these insights, we’re continuing to refine LLM integrations and to ensure that LLMs can be depended upon for common use cases at home.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-06-voice-chapter-7/voice-script.png' alt="Exposing voice scripts to Assist in Home Assistant Voice settings" class='no-shadow'>
<p>You can now expand LLM capabilities by <a href="/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#expand-an-llm-using-your-scripts">allowing them access to your scripts</a>. This feature lets you precisely control what the LLM does in specific situations, while still benefiting from the flexibility and natural language processing that AIs excel at.</p>
<h4>In progress: Investigate on privacy</h4>
<p>Since our last roadmap update, we have expanded the product and design team working on the Home Assistant project, and we have hired our first ever dedicated user researcher!</p>
<p>While we are ramping up our user research pipeline, we have started working on investigating what privacy means to our users. Of the three Open Home values, privacy, choice, and sustainability, while we have a pretty solid understanding of choice and some understanding of sustainability, the idea of privacy can benefit from more clarity. We have interviewed a handful of users on this topic recently, and we can’t wait to show you what we have found.</p>
<h2>Home Assistant Cloud</h2>
<p>Home Assistant Cloud, powered by our commercial partner Nabu Casa brings, to the many, the hard-to-reach features of Home Assistant usually reserved for power users with expensive hardware at home, with no compromise on privacy.</p>
<p>In recent months, the Nabu Casa team has been hard at work in bringing peace of mind to using Home Assistant. For the cloud backup feature, the Home Assistant team and the Nabu Casa team are now working closely together on a comprehensive revamp of backup integrations, to create an easy one-stop solution to a good backup strategy. We are also working to ensure users have a smooth onboarding for backing up to Home Assistant Cloud, as well as other third-party backup locations.</p>
<p>The team had to postpone some features in favor of others like <a href="/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#low-latency-cameras-using-webrtc">WebRTC</a>. They had successfully released the infrastructure needed to support WebRTC, both STUN servers for every Home Assistant user and TURN servers for every Home Assistant Cloud subscriber, enhancing real-time communication capabilities within Home Assistant. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is one of the postponed features, but it is still in the Nabu Casa pipeline.</p>
<h2>Open Protocols</h2>
<p>We remain committed to supporting open smart home standards, including Z-Wave Zigbee, Matter, and Thread, aligning with our Open Home mission to offer choice, privacy, and sustainability through locally controlled, cloud-independent devices.</p>
<p>In the past six months, we have made significant steps towards certifications, ensuring our open standards implementations are up to industry standards.</p>
<h3>Z-Wave</h3>
<p>In <a href="/blog/2024/09/24/we-are-joining-the-z-wave-alliance-board/">September</a>, Paulus, the founder of Home Assistant, announced his new role on the Z-Wave Alliance Board of Directors, representing Nabu Casa. Serving on the board will allow Nabu Casa to contribute meaningfully to Z-Wave’s development and ensure that the needs of Home Assistant users and open-source values are represented.</p>
<p>As interest in Z-Wave devices in our ecosystem continues to grow, this has driven Home Assistant to advance the Z-Wave JS stack and create its own Z-Wave hardware. While we are working on the <a href="/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead">certification of our Z-Wave implementation</a>, our work on building our own Z-Wave antenna has also been progressing smoothly. We base the design of our antenna on the <a href="https://github.com/drzwave/ZRAD">Z-Wave Reference Application Design</a> to create a Z-Wave antenna with the best performance in the market.</p>
<h3>Matter</h3>
<p>As one of the first in the industry, in June, we proudly announced that Home Assistant is now based on the <a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#matter-turns-13">latest Matter 1.3 specification</a>. Since then, we continued to update our Matter implementation to improve the reliability and compatibility of Matter devices, and Matter certification should hopefully happen any day now soon!</p>
<p>We have brought expanded device support and performance improvements to Home Assistant’s Matter integration. Air purifiers, room air conditioners, and thermostats are now better supported, along with custom clusters, which allow Home Assistant to detect data changes in real-time, improving network efficiency.</p>
<p>Update entities now provide firmware updates via official Matter update channels, while event entities provide more event types, allowing you to react to single-press or double-press events with ease. Additional features include water valve support, operation state tracking for appliances, and smoke and CO sensor integration. Matter 1.3 power and energy sensors are also supported, providing useful data for the energy dashboard.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we will continue to work on Matter 1.4 compatibility, as well as making device commissioning easier and working with Thread credentials. We have made major strides forward and hopefully we will be able to get through some of our roadblocks soon.</p>
<h3>Zigbee</h3>
<p>The Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA) integration got a massive overhaul <a href="/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#zigbee-home-automation-zha-updates">during Summer</a>. The whole integration has been split into a separate codebase, making it easier to maintain and improve. This is a huge step forward for the integration, and took months of work to get done. This change will make the integration easier to maintain and improve in the future, including allowing code contributors to contribute more easily.</p>
<h2>What’s next?</h2>
<p>We hope that you can feel the results of all this work.  Given the positive feedback we have received from our users, we will continue to follow our roadmap to work on the next product initiatives.</p>
<p>We will also start preparing for the roadmap for next year. It will have a new theme, and we would like to have our community be more involved in the process of its creation. Planning has already begun, and we hope to announce it at the next State of the Open Home. Last but not the least, please get in the comments and give us your feedback - we read it all!</p>
<p>See you next year!</p>

<h2>Sections dashboard no longer experimental!</h2>
<p>This release marks a big milestone in our pursuit of making dashboards easier to
customize and use for everyone, aka <a href="/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/">Project Grace</a>! The sections view layout,
together with its drag-and-drop 🐲 capabilities and responsive design,
is now <strong>out of its experimental phase</strong>, and ready for primetime! This means
that, as of this release, you will get our awesome feature-rich and easy-to-use
dashboard editing experience when you create a new dashboard. 🎉</p>
<p>Over the past few months, we have worked hard to iterate and listen to your
feedback to ensure that our new dashboard is easy to customize for both
beginners and advanced users alike. We have added new capabilities such as
<a href="/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/">resizing cards</a>, <a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/">visibility options</a>, <a href="/blog/2024/09/04/release-20249/">wider sections</a>, <a href="/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/">new badges</a>,
and, most recently, adding <a href="/blog/2024/10/02/release-202410/">the new heading card</a>.</p>
<p>To finish this journey, we are adding two more features to this release.</p>
<h3>Convert your old dashboards to sections view layout</h3>
<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections" src="/images/blog/2024-11/dashboard-conversion.png"/>Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections</p>
<p>This release includes a way to convert individual dashboard views from the old
masonry view layout to the new sections view layout. When you change the view
type to sections, you get a button to convert the view. All the cards of the
old view are then copied and placed in an imported cards section in the new
view, and you can then easily drag-and-drop them into the right sections.</p>
<p>Please note that cards placed within the imported cards section are only visible
to users once moved to a section above the fold. This ensures that
cards do not get accidentally shown in the wrong sections while you are still
working on the dashboard.</p>
<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the imported cards section" src="/images/blog/2024-11/imported-cards.png"/>Screenshot of the imported cards section</p>
<p>If you are not ready for the new layout yet, no worries! Your old dashboard view
is kept when a new dashboard is created, giving an excellent way for masonry
view veterans to try out sections while keeping all the hard work they have put
into customizing their cards.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can move each card one-by-one from another view. All moved
cards will also be temporarily placed in the imported cards section.</p>
<h3>Precise mode for card sizes</h3>
<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Examples of cards using precise mode" src="/images/blog/2024-11/precise-mode-example.png" style="width: 60%;"/>Examples of cards using precise mode</p>
<p>If you love tinkering with your dashboards and fine-tuning card sizes with more
precision, you now have even more control over the size of cards. In the layout
options of a card you can now enable “Precise mode”, which will give you three
times more options for the card widths!</p>
<p>Precise mode is applied on a card-by-card level. While a normal section is
divided into 4 columns, precise modes gives you 12 columns, which allows you
to align 2, 3, 4, or 6 buttons side-by-side.</p>
<h2>Low latency cameras using WebRTC</h2>
<p>Lots of effort has gone into this new and amazing feature for this release:
<strong>WebRTC</strong>! 🎉</p>
<center><p class='no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Logo of WebRTC" src="/images/blog/2024-11/webrtc-logo-horiz-retro.png" /></p></center>
<p>Not sure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">what WebRTC is</a>? No worries! Let us try to explain. If you are
watching a camera in Home Assistant, you might have noticed it is sometimes
a bit slow and delayed. WebRTC support is going to change that!</p>
<p>Camera streams will now try to use WebRTC whenever possible.
<a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC is a standard</a> that makes a peer-to-peer connection for lower-latency
audio and video streaming. You are probably using this technology a lot already,
for example, when having an online video call. When you’re away from home,
it will try to find the fastest and most direct path between your Home Assistant
instance and the camera you are trying to view.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">The Open Home Foundation</a> will host the negotiating network infrastructure
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN">STUN servers</a>) <strong>for free for all Home Assistant users</strong> and enable the
capability to use WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections whenever possible. If you are using Home Assistant OS or our containers, after you update this will automatically work out of the box.</p>
<center><p class='no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Logo of the Open Home Foundation" src="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/assets/images/logo/open-home-foundation.svg" style="width: 90%" /></p></center>
<p>Sometimes, a direct connection between the client (like your browser
or mobile app) and the camera is not possible; in those situations, the camera
stream needs to be relayed by an external server. <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> now
provides this relay server (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT">TURN server</a>), and it’s <strong>included as one of the many benefits</strong>
available to all subscribers!</p>
<p>So, no matter where you are, you should always be able to watch your cameras
via this low-latency technology. If, for whatever reason, WebRTC is not
available, it will fall back to using the old method of streaming to ensure
you can always see your camera feeds.</p>
<p>So, after reading all of this, what changed? Well, camera feeds will do everything they did before, but will be faster, more responsive, and less delayed! 🎉</p>

</ul>
<h3>Noteworthy improvements to existing integrations</h3>
<p>It is not just new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have been added; existing
integrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy
changes to existing integrations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joostlek">@joostlek</a> has extended the <a href="/integrations/spotify">Spotify integration</a> with a whole bunch of new
sensors for the current song playing. You can now, for example, automate
putting your house into party mode 🎉 when the song playing is danceable
enough 😎 Awesome job!</li>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/linkplay">LinkPlay integration</a> now has multiroom support! Group and ungroup your
devices to play music in sync or individually straight from Home Assistant.
Thanks <a href="https://github.com/silamon">@silamon</a>!</li>
<li>Staying in the audio department, <a href="https://github.com/mj23000">@mj23000</a> added shuffle and repeat controls
to the <a href="/integrations/bang_olufsen">Bang &amp; Olufsen integration</a>. Nice!</li>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/vicare">ViCare integration</a> now supports room sensors and hot water storage
sensors. Thanks for that <a href="https://github.com/CFenner">@CFenner</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/starkillerOG">@starkillerOG</a> added sensors to track the total number of installations and
integrations to the <a href="/integrations/analytics_insights">Analytics Insights integration</a>. Nice!</li>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/habitica">Habitica integration</a> now supports sensors for gems, mystic hourglasses,
and calendars for to-dos and daily tasks. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/tr4nt0r">@tr4nt0r</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/YoavGivati">@YogevBokobza</a> added support for the <a href="https://switcher.co.il/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%A8/runner-lights-s12/">Switcher Runner S12</a> to the

<li>A little more technical, but <a href="https://github.com/jbouwh">@jbouwh</a> added support for
<a href="/integrations/mqtt/#device-discovery-payload">MQTT device-based auto discovery</a>. This allows MQTT devices to be set up
and discovered once instead of separately for each entity; which is much
more efficient. Nice improvement!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>
<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.</p>
<p>The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/local_file">Local file</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/gjohansson-ST">@gjohansson-ST</a></li>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/onkyo">Onkyo</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/Nebula83">@Nebula83</a></li>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/smarty">Smarty</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">@joostlek</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are also no longer available as
of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bloomsky</strong>. Their service shut down.</li>
<li><strong>Google Domains</strong>. The domain registration service by Google has been
shut down.</li>
<li><strong>Spider</strong>. The service is no longer available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/image">Image entities</a> now have a snapshot action, allowing you to save the current
image in the entity to a file. Nice <a href="https://github.com/NickM-27">@NickM-27</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a> added <a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#limited-templates">(limited) template</a> support to the “at” field of <a href="/docs/automation/trigger/#time-trigger">time triggers</a>.
This allows you to template the time of that trigger in, for example,
a blueprint automation.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile">Nautical miles</a> (<code>nmi</code>) is now a valid distance unit. This means you can now
use this as a unit for your distance sensors. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/mib1185">@mib1185</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tetele">@tetele</a> added <a href="/integrations/template/#using-blueprints">blueprints for template entities</a>! This allows for easier
re-use and sharing of common blueprints for sets of templated entities.
This is an advanced feature and is only available using manual YAML
configuration.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matthiasdebaat">@matthiasdebaat</a> have improved the network settings user
interface. It is now easier to manage and configure your network settings,
including nicer handling of IP addresses, improved Wi-Fi configuration,
and better visibility on the URLs Home Assistant is using for your instance.</li>
<li>We now indicate if a custom integration is overriding a built-in integration.
This makes it easier to spot if a custom integration is taking over a
built-in integration while you are wondering why you didn’t get the latest
features Home Assistant releases bring. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Live logs</h3>
<p>Sometimes, if something does not work as expected, you might resort to a more technical
tool for finding out what is going on: The logs.</p>
<p>Previously, if you looked at the logs of, for example, an add-on or the Home
Assistant Supervisor, you would only see the last 100 log lines. You would
have had to refresh the page to see new log entries.</p>
<p>Well, no more! As of this release, the logs are now <strong>streaming live</strong>! 🎉</p>
<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the imported cards section" src="/images/blog/2024-11/streaming-live-logs.gif"/>Screen recording demonstrating logs showing up as they happen.</p>
<p>And not just that, you can scroll back in time to see previous log items.
That’s a pretty cool improvement. 😎</p>
<h2>Voice</h2>
<p>Last year, 2023, was the <a href="/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/">Year of the Voice</a> for Home Assistant. And while this
year isn’t specifically dedicated to voice, everyone is still working hard
towards the goal of letting users control their homes with their voice in
their own language.</p>
<p>As you might have heard through many community channels 🕵️‍♀️, we are working to
make this a reality for everyone. We are hard at work getting our Home Assistant
voice satellite hardware ready and available for selling and shipping! 🤗</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more information on that soon!</p>
<h3>Home Assistant intents improvements</h3>
<p>One of the things we are working on is the Home Assistant intents. This is a
way for a voice assistant to understand the intention behind your spoken
sentences. This is a very crucial part of a local voice assistant.</p>
<p>In this release, we decided to align and combine Canadian French and French languages for the time being. Though we understand it is a unique dialect, this is about giving Canadian French users a lot more voice features.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-11/canadian-french-on-assist.png" alt="Screenshot showing a few commands in Canadian French before and after this release" /></p>
<p>These intents are built and maintained by the community, and we are very
grateful for their work. For example, <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jlpouffier">@jlpouffier</a> have made a
great effort to lead the French language intents mentioned above.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we want to ensure everyone can use Home Assistant in their
own language, <strong>so we need your help</strong>! Help the community by contributing to
the intents for your language. You can find more information on how to do that
in our <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/contributing">developer documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>Join the Wake Word Collective</h3>
<p>Another essential part of voice is the Wake Word! And this is where <strong>everyone</strong>,
no matter your skill level, can help out with just a minute of your time!</p>
<p>Wake words are the words you say to wake up your voice assistant. For example,
<em>“Hey Google”</em> or <em>“Alexa”</em>. As we are building our own voice assistant with
our own wake words, we need to train our models to recognize these words,
regardless of your accent, language, gender, or age.</p>
<p>So, get your whole home involved 🏠! Take a minute to help us out by recording your voice
saying the wake word. It is super easy, and you can do it right from your
browser or mobile, no need to install anything!</p>
<p><a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/"><strong>Help us improve our wake words today! ❤️</strong></a></p>
<p>You can read more about the Wake Word Collective in our
<a href="/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/">dedicated blog post</a>.</p>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.11 in November.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

occupancy as linked doorbell sensors. However, linked doorbell sensors can

    <updated>2024-10-24T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-10-wake-word-collective/art.jpg' alt="Help us improve voice">
<p>Give us a minute of your time and <a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/">lend your voice</a> to improve our community-driven, privacy-focused voice assistant, and together we’ll break big tech’s stranglehold on home voice control.</p>
<p>When you use Home Assistant Assist we’ll never take your data unwillingly to improve its functionality; that’s why we’re asking for your help today (more on that below).</p>
<p>Specifically, we’re trying to improve our wake word engine, which “wakes” the device to listen for more commands. Our open source <a href="https://github.com/kahrendt/microWakeWord">microWakeWord</a> engine is an incredible, lightweight bit of code but requires training with real voices to improve. Everyone’s voice is unique, and we need recordings of people of all genders, ages, and accents from around the world saying this wake word. So get the whole home involved, along with friends and family.</p>
<p><a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/"><strong>Help us today</strong></a></p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Your voice, your choice</h2>
<p>Privacy is at the core of everything we do, and that’s what’s driving us to build an open, local, and private voice assistant. Years ago a voice assistant arms race began between a couple of big tech companies, where they sold very cheap voice hardware, all because they wanted your data. They used that voice data to rapidly improve their voice capabilities (and who knows what else) at <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47893082">the expense of your privacy</a>.</p>
<p>We will never use those tactics to improve Home Assistant. We do something novel and bewildering to the smart home industry - we explicitly ask for your help. For instance, Home Assistant has <a href="https://analytics.home-assistant.io/">opt-in statistics</a>; these really help us focus on what people are using and put resources into making the biggest impact. When you <a href="/integrations/analytics/">opt-in it really helps</a>, but we totally understand if you don’t - it’s your home and your data. We’re doing the same with voice, explicitly asking for help, and would love your help to improve its wake word capability.</p>
<p>What big tech might consider a weakness is actually our greatest strength - privacy empowers our users, allowing them to not worry about being tracked or classified by an algorithm.</p>
<h2>microWakeWord goes global</h2>
<p>microWakeWord is a very lightweight wake word engine that can run on ESP32-class devices. This allows the voice assistant to listen for a specific phrase, for instance “Okay Nabu”, and ignore all other noise and speech until it hears that. Running it on-device speeds everything up significantly, cutting out the lag from streaming audio continuously to a more powerful device running wake word software. The downside to running it on-device is the amount of training required to get good results.</p>
<p>A few months ago, we promoted an early version of this Wake Word Collective tool in the Open Home Foundation newsletter (<a href="https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/">subscribe if you haven’t already</a>). From that one email alone, we received over 5,800 samples covering 30 different languages. While microWakeWord used to only excel at picking up the English pronunciation of “Okay Nabu”, it’s now many times more effective at picking up different accents. Our testing shows our model trained on this data falsely rejects 5% of samples, while previous models rejected 18%, which shows your samples are making a difference!</p>
<p>We still need more different types of voices from different parts of the world. If you or your family use Assist and find it still struggling to wake up to hear your commands, this is the perfect opportunity to lend your voice to the project.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Before you start recording you will fill in what language you’re most comfortable speaking, allowing us to train language-specific wake word models that are better at detecting subtle differences in pronunciation. You must also read and agree to the <a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/terms.html">Wake Word Collective terms</a>. This explains, among other things, that these recordings will be made available publicly under a Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication. We operate our research openly for the benefit of all, and that is why these will be available to the public.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-10-wake-word-collective/demo.gif' alt="Animation showing how to use the wake word collective tool">
<p>Next, it explains that you only need you to say two words,  “Okay, Nabu”, a couple of times.  You’ll need to set down your phone, tablet, or laptop, and walk around the room, saying the wake word whenever the circle on the screen turns green. Taking samples from all around the room better reflects the real-world use of a voice assistant. Don’t worry about background noise; it’s useful for training.</p>
<p>I said this would only take a minute, but you’ve probably been reading this for longer, so go on and <a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/">get recording</a>.</p>

    <link href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/10/02/connect-zbt1-issue-and-replacement/"/>
    <updated>2024-10-02T00:01:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/10/02/connect-zbt1-issue-and-replacement</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-10-zbt1-issue/art.jpg' alt="Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 issue and replacement">
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>
  <p class="alert-content">
<p>The replacement program is now operational, please contact the retailer where you purchased your device to request a replacement. The replacement program only covers ZBT-1 branded devices purchased prior to October 2024, and not SkyConnect-branded devices (identify which device you have <a href="#do-i-have-a-zbt-1">with this graphic</a>).</p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>We’ve found an issue in Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 that has affected a small number of customers, which appears to be the result of a faulty part incorporated in the first production run of ZBT-1 devices, causing the device to fail and become completely unresponsive. We want to make sure everyone can get a replacement ZBT-1 and ensure they are covered far into the future.</p>
<p>Though Home Assistant SkyConnect is identical to the ZBT-1 under the hood, <strong>it is not affected</strong>. The design is not what’s at fault, but instead, a defective voltage regulator that was used in this specific production run that is causing the issue. When a ZBT-1 is inserted into certain USB-A ports, the voltage regulator can fail, fully bricking the device. We used high-quality manufacturing and quality control in this and previous production runs. We are undertaking an investigation to find out how this could happen and most importantly, to avoid a repeat of anything remotely similar in the future.</p>
<p>We’re sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you. Below are details on our investigation, how devices are affected, and the replacement program.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Around a month ago, we were contacted about one of our latest (and <a href="/blog/2024/06/13/zbt1-annoucement/">recently rebranded</a>) Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1s not being detected and showing a deformation on the housing. A couple more similar issues were reported, and we began a dialogue with the small number of people who were affected, having them send us the devices to test.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-10-zbt1-issue/zbt1-issue.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="ZBT-1 case deformation and faulty voltage regulator">Circled in red the deformation on the case and the board showing the failed chip</p>
<p>Indeed, the device no longer worked at all, not being detected by any device it was connected to. When we opened them, we found a dead voltage regulator. Though SkyConnect devices can also develop a small discoloration on the outside casing after long-term use, and this is not a sign of failure, the deeper deformation in the outer casing pictured above is a sign that the ZBT-1 has overheated and failed. All of our devices are certified by CE and ROHS, and the plastic shell has been designed not to combust. This is a real-life demonstration of just how important this certification is and why we take that step.</p>
<p>We replaced the voltage regulator on the devices we tested, and the devices sprang back to life. We found our culprit, but why was it failing? As mentioned, the SkyConnect internal design and the manufacturing were effectively identical to the ZBT-1, and we received no reports of any such failures in the literally tens of thousands of them in the wild. In manufacturing runs there is always a little variance, and in this run, something went wrong with the voltage regulator that was sourced - again, we’re looking into this.</p>
<p>It took us a couple of weeks to replicate the problem with our own units. We went down some wrong paths, but eventually found it was triggered only by certain devices, specifically certain desktop PCs (internally, we have only found one desktop that causes this failure). We have not observed the failure occur when the device has only been connected to a Home Assistant Green, Raspberry Pi, or even a Mac. If you have plugged your ZBT-1 into a different device, specifically a desktop PC, and it is not recognized by that system, inspect it for this deformation pictured above. Obviously, we want you to be able to use the device with any hardware, and even if only a small number of devices from this production run have reported issues, it is still unacceptable to us.</p>
<h2>Do I have a ZBT-1?</h2>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-10-zbt1-issue/skyconnect-zbt1.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="SkyConnect (left) and ZBT-1 (right)">
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9rem;">SkyConnect (left) and ZBT-1 (right) branded devices, SkyConnect are unaffected by this issue.</p>
<h2>Pausing sales</h2>
<p>We have asked our distributors to pause sales and return all stock. For the next month, you will see “Out of Stock” banners, and if you are attempting to get a replacement device for a failed unit, this will not be possible until production is resumed.</p>
<p>We are working to have replacement ZBT-1s shipped by early November.</p>
<h2>Replacement Program</h2>
<p>If you have purchased Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1, we are working on a replacement program. This program will see Nabu Casa provide a replacement device free of charge for a period of 60 months (5 years) for verified purchases. Regardless of whether the device has failed, we will provide a replacement upon request.</p>
<p>It is a core value of ours to do things as sustainably as possible, and that’s why we’ve provided such a long coverage period. We want to give owners with working ZBT-1s, who do not expect to use the device in a different system for the foreseeable future, the ability to keep it operating with peace of mind.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>
  <p class="alert-content">
<p>All ZBT-1 branded devices produced, as of October 2024, are believed to have this fault. You can tell if your device is a ZBT-1 by checking the white label on the back for “ZBT-1” (identify which device you have <a href="#do-i-have-a-zbt-1">with this graphic</a>). There is no need to test if your device is affected by this fault.</p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>If it’s working, keep it plugged into the device it’s working with, and don’t worry about a replacement until you need it. If you need or want a replacement, please contact the seller where you purchased your device, and they will arrange the return process and replacement. Replacement devices are expected by early November, and we will be prioritizing people with non-functioning devices.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We’re sorry for the inconvenience and any disruption to your smart home. As someone who uses Zigbee in their home, which many smart devices rely on, I would hate to have it out of commission.</p>
<p>Worse things can happen, but this has been a gut punch. All our work at Nabu Casa is to fund the development of Home Assistant and support the Open Home. Issues like this eat into our time, and rob our users of new and great things. Ultimately, we’re going to take this setback as a chance to prove we stand by our values and do the right thing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><lite-youtube videoid="_X2-encNyrA" videotitle="Home Assistant 2024.10 Release Party"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>Boo! 👻</p>
<p>Please don’t be scared; it is October, Halloween is coming, and so is the next
Home Assistant release: 2024.10! 🎃</p>
<p>The release we bring you today is a perfect mix of new UI features, advanced
features, improvements, and lots of bug fixes while not being too overwhelming.
There is something for everyone in this release.</p>
<p>Most notably, we have a brand new heading card. It allows you to add titles or
subtitles to your dashboards, make them clickable, and even add cute little
entities to them. The new section dashboard gets better and better with every
release, which is super exciting!</p>
<p>We also introduce some small YAML automation syntax changes. If you are still
a sucker for writing your automations in <span class='terminology'>YAML<span class='terminology-tooltip'>YAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the <code>configuration.yaml</code> or <code>automations.yaml</code> files.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/yaml/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> (like me), I’m sure you’ll love
these little tweaks that make it all feel more natural.</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>Heading in the right direction</h2>
<p>Update after update, <a href="/dashboards/sections/">Sections</a> continues to become a customization powerhouse,
and this month is no exception. Section titles are replaced with their own card,
called the <a href="/dashboards/heading/">heading card</a>. Making them a card rather than an inline title gives
you a lot more flexibility, allowing you to put them nearly anywhere.</p>
<p>The heading card can be used to make titles, but also subtitles, which are half
the height and have smaller, lighter text. So, if you have ever had a section
that needs to be subdivided, slap a subtitle in there.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-10/headings.png" alt="Screenshot showing a dashboard using heading cards with titles and subtitles" /></p>
<p>Titles and subtitles can be made clickable, displaying a chevron
<iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:chevron-right' title='Chevron right'></iconify-icon> when you can interact with them. This can
perform an action or navigate to a subpage, like having an energy section title
navigate to the full energy dashboard.</p>
<p>Best of all, if you’ve already added titles to your sections, they will be
migrated automatically to the new card. 😎</p>
<h3>Another headline feature</h3>
<p>We had such a fantastic reaction when we released our <a href="/dashboards/badges/">renewed badges</a>,
and this new heading card has something very similar and equally as visually
appealing. It can show multiple entity states to the right of the title or
subtitle.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-10/heading-with-entities.png" alt="Screenshot showing a dashboard with additional entities shown on card headings" /></p>
<p>Either in a subtle “no color” default or add a splash of color when the entity
is in an active state. Other customization options for these entities include
changing the icon, visibility, and what happens when you select it.</p>
<h2>Repairs for long-term statistics</h2>
<p><a href="https://data.home-assistant.io/docs/statistics/">Long-term statistics</a> are great; they downsample and store the data produced
by your <span class='terminology'>sensors<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Sensors return information about a thing, for instance the level of water in a tank.<a class='terminology-link' href='/integrations/sensor/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>, allowing Home Assistant to store data indefinitely
in a fraction of the space the original readings took up. Take a look back at
<a href="/docs/energy/">your energy usage</a> from two years ago, or see if your living room really is
colder this year compared to last.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-10/statistics-repair.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing a long-term statistic repair showing up in the settings menu" /></p>
<p>In the past, if a statistic encountered an issue, it might be quietly broken
until you dig into the statistics page. Now, Home Assistant will raise a repair
notification when it detects issues with a long-term statistic and give
you options for fixing the issue.</p>
<h2>Improved YAML syntax for automations</h2>
<p>Recently, we renamed <code>service</code> to <code>action</code> in the <a href="/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#goodbye-service-calls-hello-actions-">Home Assistant UI and YAML</a>.
This was done with the goal of making the syntax more natural, allowing it
to be easier to grasp and read. We want to continue this work to improve the
<span class='terminology'>YAML<span class='terminology-tooltip'>YAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the <code>configuration.yaml</code> or <code>automations.yaml</code> files.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/yaml/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> syntax, this time focusing on <span class='terminology'>automations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Automations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>, and we’ve made the
following changes,</p>
<ul>
<li>The top-level <code>trigger</code> key is now <code>triggers</code> (plural)</li>
<li>The top-level <code>condition</code> key is now <code>conditions</code> (plural)</li>
<li>The top-level <code>action</code> key is now <code>actions</code> (plural)</li>
<li>The <code>platform</code> key of a trigger definition is now <code>trigger</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The result of all this is that YAML automation syntax now has <code>triggers</code> with
multiple <code>trigger</code> definitions, <code>conditions</code> with multiple <code>condition</code>
definitions, and <code>actions</code> with multiple <code>action</code> definitions.</p>
<p>Here is a small example of an automation highlighting these changes.</p>
<p class="img">
<img src="/images/blog/2024-10/YAML-automation-syntax-changes.png" alt="Screenshots; left showing the old automation YAML style, right showing the new style. The differences between them have been highlighted.">
The 2024.9 release on the left and this 2024.10 release on the right.
</p>
<p>As with the other syntax changes we’ve done recently, this is
<strong>not a breaking change</strong>, and there will be no deprecation. The previous syntax
will continue to work, and there are no plans to remove the old syntax. The new
syntax is recommended, and all documentation and examples have been updated.
Automations managed by the automation editor will automatically be migrated to
the new syntax when saving an automation.</p>
<p>This is not the only change to our syntax, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a> we now support
<a href="/docs/automation/trigger/#merging-lists-of-triggers">merging a list of triggers</a>, which is mostly useful for
<span class='terminology'>blueprint<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A blueprint is a script, automation or template entity configuration with certain parts marked as configurable. This allows users to create multiple scripts, automations or template entities based on the same blueprint, with each having its own configuration-specific settings.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/blueprint/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> authors.</p>
<h2>Faster upgrades when using custom integrations</h2>
<p>We want Home Assistant to continue to work on a wide range of hardware. If you
look at our <a href="https://analytics.home-assistant.io/">opt-in analytics</a> you’ll see a sizable amount of homes running it
on single-board computers from the mid-2010s. A lot of effort has been put into
keeping Home Assistant lean, and this release has some good improvements. This
is specially for users of custom integrations, and this follows HACS getting a
great <a href="/blog/2024/08/21/hacs-the-best-way-to-share-community-made-projects/#faster-downloads">speed boost for downloads</a>.</p>
<p>On each upgrade, all dependencies needed for <span class='terminology'>custom integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A custom integration is an integration that has been created by someone from the Home Assistant community and has been published for others to use at their own risk. Custom integrations are not supported by the Home Assistant project.

An example of a custom integration is the <a href="https://spook.boo/">Spook</a> integration.</span></span>

process so fast nowadays, and <a href="https://github.com/edenhaus">@edenhaus</a> has done an interesting
<a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/04/03/build-images-with-uv/">developer backstory</a> on our move from <code>pip</code> to <code>uv</code> (saving us 200+ hours
of execution time a month). <a href="https://github.com/edenhaus">@edenhaus</a> has also implemented <code>uv</code> at runtime
as well.</p>
<p>This speeds up the upgrade process, especially for custom integrations with many
dependencies, or installations with many custom integrations. This change is
fully transparent to the user, and no action is required. Just sit down, relax,
and enjoy the faster upgrade process!</p>

<p>It is not just new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have been added; existing
integrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy
changes to existing integrations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Bre77">@Bre77</a> has been busy with the <a href="/integrations/tesla_fleet">Tesla Fleet</a> integration, adding a bunch of
new features and entities to control your Tesla vehicle. It now supports
climate, media player, cover, number, select, button, and lock entities.</li>
<li>You can now control the volume, ringtone, and status light of your <a href="/integrations/reolink">Reolink</a>
Hub! Cool, <a href="https://github.com/starkillerOG">@starkillerOG</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/daniel-k">@daniel-k</a> added support for controlling the volume and <a href="https://github.com/sdb9696">@sdb9696</a> added a

and support for  your favorites straight from the media browser.
Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/pssc">@pssc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rajlaud">@rajlaud</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tronikos">@tronikos</a> added <a href="/integrations/google_cloud">Google Cloud</a> speech-to-text (STT) to Home Assistant. This
allows you to use Google’s Cloud speech-to-text with <a href="/voice_control">Assist</a>! Awesome!</li>
<li>If you are using the <a href="/integrations/husqvarna_automower">Husqvarna Automower</a>, you can now view the calendar
it provides, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Thomas55555">@Thomas55555</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/klaasnicolaas">@klaasnicolaas</a> added support for home batteries to the <a href="/integrations/autarco">Autarco</a>
integration so you can use them in your energy dashboard. Great!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>
<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.</p>
<p>The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/emoncms">Emoncms</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/alexandrecuer">@alexandrecuer</a></li>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/google_cloud">Google Cloud Platform</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/tronikos">@tronikos</a></li>

<li><strong><a href="/integrations/mold_indicator">Mold Indicator</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/gjohansson-ST">@gjohansson-ST</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Matter</h2>
<p>At this point, our <a href="/integrations/matter">Matter integration</a> is almost becoming a monthly recurring
topic in our release notes. For a good reason! The development is moving forward
at a strong pace; running toward the certification finish line!</p>
<center><img src='/images/supported_brands/matter.png' alt='Matter logo' class='no-shadow'></center><br>
<p>In terms of stability, we have improved the robustness of the integration to
ensure it sets up correctly every time, even if an issue with one
of your devices occurs. Besides the usual bugfixes and improvements, this
release has some cool new features and additions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Button entities</strong><br />
New button entities that allow you to perform an action on a device. For
example, to identify a device or reset the filter state.</li>
<li><strong>Valve entities</strong><br />
Support for water valves, allowing you to control the flow of fluids or gases.</li>
<li><strong>Support for operation states</strong><br />
Control and monitor the operation state of, for example, dishwashers
and other household equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Support for smoke and CO sensors</strong><br />
Monitor the air quality in your home with smoke and CO sensors.</li>
<li><strong>Add support for Matter 1.3 power/energy sensors</strong><br />
Especially the energy sensors are great to use with the energy dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>In June, we added support for adding <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/07/16/device-info-model-id">Model IDs to devices</a>. This release
has lots of integrations that add them, including <a href="/integrations/matter">Matter</a>, <a href="/integrations/plugwise">Plugwise</a>,
<a href="/integrations/wallbox">Wallbox</a>, and <a href="/integrations/govee_light_local">Govee</a>. We are calling for contributions to add model IDs to
more integrations! Maybe a cool suggestion for an <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> contribution!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bmesuere">@bmesuere</a> improved the accessibility of all graphs by adjusting all the
default colors used in those graphs! You are a hero!</li>
<li>When you unignore an integration or device on the integrations page,
Home Assistant will instantly try to rediscover it again! Nice! Thanks,
<a href="https://github.com/emontnemery">@emontnemery</a>!</li>
<li>We now have a new unit of measurement for energy entities: calories. Useful,
for devices like a treadmill or an exercise bike. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/dudanov">@dudanov</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/TrevorSchirmer">@TrevorSchirmer</a> did something similar, and added a new unit of speed:
mm/s and in/s. Thank you!</li>
<li>When you rename a device, you will now see more details about the rename
operation. Including a preview of the new entity IDs. Nice, <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gjohansson-ST">@gjohansson-ST</a> added a new template function <a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#merge-action-responses"><code>merge_response</code></a> that
allows you to merge multiple responses of a single action or multiple actions
into a single response. Nice!</li>
<li><a href="/integrations/template/#trigger-based-template-binary-sensors-buttons-images-numbers-selects-and-sensors">Trigger-based templates</a> now have support for adding conditions! Just like
automations, you can now add conditions to these entities to control when
they are rendered. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/chammp">@chammp</a>!</li>
<li>More template fun! You can now set up your templated alarm control panel
straight from the UI. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/gjohansson-ST">@gjohansson-ST</a>!</li>
<li>The statistics developer tools have been improved. They now have the new-style
data tables and the ability to bulk select items to action. Awesome <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>!</li>
<li>There is a new entity in town, the <a href="/integrations/assist_satellite/"><code>assist satellite</code> entity</a>.
It is a building block for remote satellites devices that use <a href="/voice_control">Assist</a>. This
is in preparation for our upcoming satellite hardware. Stay tuned!</li>
</ul>
<h3>The source of a repair</h3>
<p><span class='terminology'>Integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can raise issues in your repairs dashboard, they can
raise issues for themselves, but also for other integrations. An example of
such an issue is an integration that connects to your device that raises an
issue on an <span class='terminology'>automation<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Automations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that controls it.</p>
<p>The result is an automation issue in your repair center. This is cool, but
you might want to know which integration raised the issue in the first place.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/wendevlin">@wendevlin</a>, we now show the source integration of the repair issue
in the issue dialog.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-10/repair-issue-reported-by.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new repairs dialog reporting the integration that raised it.">
<h3>YAML-editor improvements</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/naps62">@naps62</a> has been busy improving the YAML editor found in the Home Assistant
user interface.</p>
<p>We now have a vertical line based on indentation, which makes it easier to see
the indentation of your YAML configuration and allows you to spot and prevent
indentation errors.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-10/YAML-editor-improvements.png" alt="Screenshot showing the YAML editor with collapsed sections and the vertical indentation line.">
<p>But he didn’t stop there. You can now collapse and expand sections of your
YAML configuration based on the indentation level; which is also demonstrated
in the screenshot above.</p>
<p>Nice work <a href="https://github.com/naps62">@naps62</a>!</p>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.10 in October. These
patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch release
every Friday.</p>

<p>To modernize the OpenTherm Gateway integration, all entities have been split
into different devices. As a result, the OpenTherm Gateway climate entity
has been moved to a new OpenTherm Thermostat device.</p>
<p>Configurations that look for the climate entity by device must be adjusted
accordingly.</p>
<p>In the process, all entities were reviewed and some were found to be irrelevant
or superfluous. These entities have been removed. All removed entities were

    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/09/24/we-are-joining-the-z-wave-alliance-board</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-09-zwave-board/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Paulus Schoutsen is joining the Z-Wave Alliance Board">
<p>Today there has been an important announcement, I (Paulus, founder of Home Assistant) will be taking a seat on the Z-Wave Alliance Board of Directors, representing Nabu Casa. This is a significant piece of recognition for the work we have put into our support of open standards, and the importance of open source projects in keeping standards successful and thriving.</p>
<p>Being part of this board allows us to play a bigger role in shaping Z-Wave’s future. As a <a href="https://z-wavealliance.org/z-wave-alliance-formalizes-standards-development-organization-and-announces-founding-members/">Standards Development Organization (SDO)</a> the Alliance is shaped by its members, and they brought us in for our connection to our community and expertise in open source. We will be giving a voice to Home Assistant users, open source development, and Open Home Foundation values.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A tenth of households with Home Assistant are using Z-Wave today, accounting for an estimated 1.7 million Z-Wave devices. We’ve seen a growing interest in Z-Wave in the Home Assistant community. This is why we have been driving forward the development of the open source <a href="https://github.com/zwave-js">Z-Wave JS</a> stack, while also developing our own <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead/#range-testing-our-z-wave-stick-prototype">Z-Wave connectivity hardware</a>.</p>
<p>As you might be well aware, we’re very keen on open standards and are continuing to put a lot of work into supporting Zigbee, Matter, Thread, and Z-Wave. These standards are important for a number of reasons that align with our <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/about/">Open Home mission</a>.</p>
<p>These standards enable greater choice, giving our users access to decades of smart home devices to add to their homes. These standards are locally controlled and don’t rely on the cloud, meaning when devices are connected through Home Assistant they provide privacy out-of-the-box. Finally, there are a lot of these devices already in use in our homes, along with second-hand devices ready for a new home. Keeping a standard alive, keeps these devices alive and using what already exists is always the most sustainable option.</p>
<p>This is not the only example of our work being recognized by these standards organizations. Recently, the Thread Group selected Nabu Casa for an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thread-group_threadgroup-internetofthings-smarthome-activity-7226619123235971072-8kHn">Innovation Enabler Award</a>, which is only awarded to two companies a year, and recognizes the “creative potential of [our] ideas and the use of Thread technology”.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead/">We believe in Z-Wave</a> and we will continually push it to align with the Open Home, so it can bring better choice, privacy, and sustainability to the home.

    <link href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/09/18/home-assistant-is-11-years-old/"/>
    <updated>2024-09-18T00:00:01+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-09-11th-anniversary/art.png' alt='Art by Clelia' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'>
<p>I’ve said it before, but Home Assistant would be nothing without its community. That’s why we decided this year to focus our anniversary celebration on acknowledging and thanking our amazing community. It’s fitting as 2024 was the year we added a dedicated community manager, <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/an-introduction-your-new-community-social-media-manager/693623">Missy Quarry</a>, who hosted this celebration of <em>you</em> in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE8yFUvQ2e4">11th Anniversary live stream</a>.</p>
<p>Missy co-hosted the stream with creator and Home Assistant community member Andrej Broz, better known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BeardedTinker">Bearded Tinker</a>. Together they threw a barrage of questions at <a href="https://github.com/frenck">Frenck</a> and <a href="https://github.com/balloob">myself</a> - we didn’t see any of them ahead of time so our responses don’t get any more real than that. It was a lot of fun, and there was even a little announcement slipped in there, so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE8yFUvQ2e4">please check it out</a>.</p>
<p>We can’t thank our community enough for the past 11 years. You are the engine driving forward Home Assistant. You put in your spare time to test, fix, build, and share your ideas. You fund our work by subscribing to <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, which allows us to devote our full attention to you, and never have to answer to a bunch of investors. We couldn’t do it without you.</p>

    <updated>2024-09-16T00:00:02+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/09/16/getting-ready-for-ios18</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-09-16/ios-og.jpg" alt="Companion App for iOS 2024.9" /></p>
<p>Bruno here once again to bring you a bunch of news on your favorite iOS App 😉. In this release, we are introducing some new features to complement the release of iOS 18, along with a new way to configure your Home Assistant Apple Watch app.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Dark and tinted app icons</h2>
<p>Within the iOS update rolling out today, Apple has introduced home screen customization for app icons. This includes a new dark mode variant and a tinted option where the user can choose an accent color for the icon. Of course Home Assistant joined the party.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-09-16/new-icons.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Dark and tinted variants are available for the main App Icon and some custom icons">Dark and tinted variants are available for the main App Icon and some custom icons</p>
<h2>Control Center</h2>
<p>The new iOS also brings a new level of customization to Control Center, for which we are introducing five new controls: Assist, Toggle light, Run script, Activate scene, and Open page.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-09-16/control-center.jpg" alt="iOS 18 Control center options" /></p>
<p>With these options, you can use Home Assistant capabilities even faster, from asking Assist a question to running a complete script flow.</p>
<p>These controls are also available to be used with the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro and 16 series. In the <a href="/blog/2024/05/22/companion-app-for-ios-20245-assist/">previous release blog</a>, we discussed that this was a great way to access Assist, in a very similar way to how you trigger Siri with the power button. Well, this release speeds this up significantly by no longer using shortcuts. Just check out the difference.</p>
<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid="v7NXQJMUK2c" videotitle="Comparing Assist launch from Shortcuts and iOS 18 Control"></lite-youtube>Assist opening on iOS 18 control (right) compared to from shortcuts (left)</p>
<h2>New Apple Watch configuration</h2>
<p>For a long time, our Watch app was only able to display <a href="https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/core/actions/">Home Assistant’s built-in iOS Actions</a>. With this release, you will be able to display scripts, scenes, iOS Actions, and more to come in the future. After updating, open the iOS App and go to companion app settings to find a new Apple Watch configuration screen where you can choose which items to display, their order, and customize the look.</p>
<p>A really useful customization is the <strong>Require confirmation</strong> option, which will prompt you with a confirmation popup before running the item. This will be very helpful if you, like me, have bad aim and accidentally open your garage door instead of turning on your TV.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-09-16/watch.png" alt="New Apple Watch configuration" /></p>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>We’re introducing new sensors, including Apple Watch battery level and state, app version, and location permission category.</li>
<li>A new Scripts home screen widget.</li>
<li>We’re working on adding Assist to the Apple Watch, try it out today, but be aware it’s still in beta.</li>
<li>Several bug fixes are included in this version,
<ul>
<li>Preventing widgets not working on iOS 15/16.</li>
<li>Allowing Watch LTE to run actions while far away from your iPhone (requires location permissions being enabled).</li>
<li>Fixing the black status bar when running older versions of Core.</li>
<li>Addressing gauge and details lock screen widgets crashing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Home Assistant 2024.9! 🎉</p>
<p>Many community members based in the northern hemisphere have taken advantage of the nicer weather to take a little time off. Home Assistant releases have continued to grow for some time, and this one might not be as gargantuan in size as previous releases, but it still packs some really cool features and announcements.</p>
<p>This release includes bigger sections, smarter energy monitoring, and a new LLM option. We’ve added <a href="#new-integrations">five</a> new integrations, along with <a href="#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui">one</a> existing integration being added to the UI. On top of all that, we’ve announced a new Works with Home Assistant partner, and the culmination of a project to ensure our project is truly open source.</p>
<p>We hope you’ve been able to enjoy some time in, and away, from your smart home this month as well.</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>Sections go BIG</h2>
<p>In the drive to give our users more customization and organization options for their dashboards, we’ve added some new options to our Sections view that really lets us take big advantage of <a href="/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#resize-the-cards-on-your-dashboard">resizable cards</a>. These powerful customization features can affect the <a href="/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#drag-and-drop-rearrangement-of-cards-and-sections">predictability of where cards or sections will go</a>, especially when switching between desktop and mobile views, and we have found it works best with large cards. As always, the choice of how to use it is up to you.</p>
<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="/images/blog/2024-09/sections-before.png" width="50%" alt="Screenshot showing sections that are all 1 section wide, on the right showing a section that is 2 sections wide.">
  <img src="/images/blog/2024-09/sections-after.png" width="50%" alt="Screenshots showing a section that is 2 sections wide.">
</div>
<h3>Wider sections</h3>
<p>Sections can be expanded to span multiple sections. Now you can, for example, have your security camera feed span two sections or have a massive three-section wide map.</p>
<p>Cards and sections will continue to follow the <a href="/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#drag-and-drop-rearrangement-of-cards-and-sections">Z-Grid rules</a>, which can lead to blank spaces if the new wider sections don’t fit on a specific part of the screen. If you don’t like those blank spaces between sections, you can choose a <em>dense</em> layout. A dense section layout option will attempt to follow the Z-Grid rules, but will fill blank spaces whenever possible. This can affect the order and predictability of your sections, but will maximize screen real estate.</p>
<p>When switching to smaller screens, these larger sections will revert to one section wide (if this causes issues for certain big cards, we would recommend using our device <a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#control-visibility-of-cards">visibility settings</a>).</p>
<img src="/images/blog/2024-09/section-settings.png" alt="Screenshot of the section settings">
<h3>Full span cards</h3>
<p>Larger sections mean larger cards. Instead of just stretching out the layout of a card, there is also a new option on cards to have them always use the full width of the section.</p>
<h3>Badges</h3>
<p>Talking about dashboards, the newly styled badges we <a href="/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#new-badges-for-your-dashboard">introduced</a> in last release, are now more configurable.</p>
<p>Instead of using display mode, you can decide for yourself what element you want to show. This allows you, for example, to hide the icon of an badge and only show the state of the device you want to show in your badge.</p>
<h2>Tracking your untracked energy</h2>
<p>In April, we introduced a <a href="/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#new-energy-graph-for-individual-devices">new energy graph for individual devices</a> in our energy dashboard. This allows you to aggregate all your energy monitoring into one graph, giving you a quick way to see your house’s biggest energy-using devices. Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>, the original creator of this graph, who has now updated it.</p>
<img src="/images/blog/2024-09/untracked-energy.png" alt="Screenshot of the individual device energy graph">
<p>We can’t all have energy tracking for every device, and if you have whole-home energy tracking (like a smart meter or <a href="/home-energy-management">something more DIY</a>) the updated graph will calculate the difference and show your home’s untracked usage. So hop onto your <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/energy/">energy dashboard</a> and start to tackle your phantom energy load.</p>
<h2>LLM agent options grow</h2>
<p>When we added the ability to use <a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#dipping-our-toes-in-the-world-of-ai-using-llms">Large Language Models (LLMs)</a> in our Voice Assistant, it began with a limited number of conversation agents. These included the cloud-based  <a href="/components/openai_conversation/">OpenAI</a> and <a href="/components/google_generative_ai_conversation/">Google AI</a> integrations, along with the locally-run <a href="/integrations/ollama/">Ollama</a> integration. All three can now control the devices in your home.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Shulyaka">@Shulyaka</a> has now added another cloud option with <a href="/integrations/anthropic">Anthropic</a> - thanks again for giving us another option for experimenting with AI in Home Assistant. Setting it up can be a little different than other conversation agents, so take a look at the <a href="/integrations/anthropic">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We have updated our <a href="https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports">LLM leaderboard</a> to include Anthropic. Both Claude 3 Haiku and Claude 3 Sonnet score very high on our benchmarks and now rank among the top. Based on the results of the benchmark, we have set the cheaper Claude 3 Haiku as the default model for the Anthropic integration.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/allenporter">@allenporter</a> added the ability to configure the context window size of the <a href="/integrations/ollama">Ollama</a> integration. The default size was increased, making it perform 20% better!</p>
<h2>Aqara joins Works with Home Assistant</h2>
<img src="/images/blog/2024-09-aqara-wwha/art.jpg" alt="Aqara join Works via Matter with Home Assistant">
<p>We <a href="/blog/2024/09/03/aqara-joins-works-with-home-assistant/">recently announced</a> that four Aqara devices are joining our <a href="https://partner.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> program.  What’s really exciting is that these are all Matter devices, and Aqara will be the first partner to use our “Works via Matter with Home Assistant” badge, giving some great options to use with Home Assistant’s amazing Matter integration.</p>
<p>What’s more, this will be the first partner to join since <a href="/blog/2024/08/08/works-with-home-assistant-becomes-part-ohf/">our recent update to the program</a>, meaning device-by-device certification that we tested ourselves. This makes it really easy to see what will give you the best experience in Home Assistant.</p>
<h2>Open source compliance</h2>
<p>We have put a lot of work into making sure that Home Assistant is truly open source, from top to bottom. This means ensuring that every library our integrations rely on uses the compliant license. We’re now at more than 2,800 integrations, so as you can imagine, this was not a small task. Working with code owners and library developers, we have painstakingly checked that every library is now using an <a href="https://opensource.org/license">OSI-approved license</a>.</p>
<p>This might seem like a small procedural thing, but it is critical to keep integrations and Home Assistant functional far into the future. If you’re not aware, libraries are what many device and service integrations rely on to function, by calling in additional protocol specific code that <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api_lib_index/">purposely</a> sits outside of the Home Assistant project. If an individual or corporation can no longer maintain libraries, a proper open source license allows it to be picked up and continued by others.</p>
<h2>Integrations</h2>
<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>
and improvements to existing ones! You’re all awesome 🥰</p>
<h3>New integrations</h3>
<p>We welcome the following new integrations in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/anthropic">Anthropic Conversation</a></strong>, added by <a href="https://github.com/Shulyaka">@Shulyaka</a><br>

user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.</p>
<p>You can now add a number <a href="/integrations/template">template helper</a> from the UI Thanks <a href="https://github.com/dougiteixeira">@dougiteixeira</a>!</p>
<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are also no longer available as
of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asterisk Call Detail Records</strong> and <strong>Asterisk Voicemail</strong>. Previously
deprecated and now removed. They have been using a deprecated mailbox feature

<h2>Backward-incompatible changes</h2>
<p>We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.</p>
<p>We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:</p>

<p>This notice applies only if you use the recorder integration with a MySQL or
PostgreSQL database. If you are using the default SQLite database,
you can ignore it.</p>
<p>Last release included a database upgrade/migration that increases the size of
the number we can store for the identifier fields.</p>
<p>Not all migrations were successful despite being marked as successful. This
release will do the migration again, but will catch unsuccessful migrations.</p>
<p>This can cause the database upgrade to take longer than usual, depending on
the size of your database.</p>
<p>Please be patient and let the upgrade process finish. Do not interrupt the
upgrade process, as this can lead to a corrupted database.</p>

Previously, we showed “up-to-date” if there was no known firmware which misrepresented the state for many devices.</p>

    <updated>2024-09-03T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/09/03/aqara-joins-works-with-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-09-aqara-wwha/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Aqara joins Works with Home Assistant">
<p>We’re excited to announce that Aqara is bringing several of their devices to our <a href="https://partner.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> program. We know that Aqara is a brand that many in the community like to recommend for its solid options for Zigbee and Matter.</p>
<p>This will be the first partner to join since <a href="/blog/2024/08/08/works-with-home-assistant-becomes-part-ohf/">our recent update to the program</a>, meaning it is the first to join certifying specific devices, making it much easier to see what will give you the best experience in Home Assistant. It will also be the first partner to use our “Works via Matter with Home Assistant” badge, giving some great options to use with Home Assistant’s <a href="https://www.matteralpha.com/news/new-home-assistant-update-matter-1-3-ai-automation">industry-leading Matter support</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Matter materializes</h2>
<p>Aqara has been an early adopter of Matter, and many of its new products support the standard, which is great for <a href="/blog/2024/01/25/matter-livestream-blog/">connecting to Home Assistant</a>. Matter allows for local control by directly connecting devices to Home Assistant, keeping your smart home data in your home. Matter is a completely local IP-based protocol that leverages your existing Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks, but it can also use <a href="/integrations/thread/">Thread</a>, which many Aqara devices take advantage of. Thread devices can be directly connected to Home Assistant using a <a href="/connectzbt1">Connect ZBT-1</a>, or can be connected to Home Assistant via an existing hub (Thread Border Router) you may already have from another <a href="/integrations/thread#google">smart home ecosystem</a>, including the Aqara Hub M3.</p>
<p>One superpower of Matter compared to other standards is being able to control these devices with multiple different ecosystems simultaneously. For instance, an Aqara lock could be unlocked with a Home Assistant automation and then locked with a voice command directed to an Apple Homepod.</p>
<h2>Devices joining the program</h2>
<p>Aqara has had the following three devices Works with Home Assistant certified. All of which can be directly connected to Home Assistant without an account.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/product/motion-and-light-sensor-p2/">Motion and Light Sensor P2</a> - Matter over Thread battery-powered motion and lux sensor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/product/door-and-window-sensor-p2/">Door and Window Sensor P2</a> - Matter over Thread battery-powered cover sensor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/product/smart-lock-u200/">Smart Lock U200</a> - Matter over Thread battery-powered lock.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re also testing the yet-to-be-launched Smart Lock U300, which we hope to see added soon.</p>
<p>We have also certified a hub that makes it easy to connect an existing Aqara-based smart home to Home Assistant using Matter.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/product/hub-m3/">Hub M3</a> - It has many functions, but we have certified it as a Matter Bridge. This means you can use it to bridge your existing Aqara Zigbee devices to Matter. It can also act as a Thread Border Router for Home Assistant.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have some Aqara products that are not listed above, rest assured that they will continue to work as they always have. The program is a way to clearly indicate which devices provide the best experience with Home Assistant. We’ve ensured this by testing these devices’ compatibility ourselves. We also get assurances from the brand that they will provide responsive support and maintenance, while being a positive brand in the Home Assistant community.</p>
<p>Works with Home Assistant is now run by the non-profit <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, which means it is not a profit-making endeavor. It is about encouraging brands to go above and beyond in the Home Assistant community, and we’re excited to have Aqara join.</p>
<p>When shopping for devices to connect to your home, we recommend first looking at our Works with Home Assistant partner’s products. These products always prioritize long-term support and local control.</p>

    <link href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/08/21/hacs-the-best-way-to-share-community-made-projects/"/>
    <updated>2024-08-21T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/08/21/hacs-the-best-way-to-share-community-made-projects</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-08-hacs2/art.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="HACS 2.0 - The best way to share community-made projects just got better">Art by Clelia Rella</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>  HACS 2.0 is a big step forward, adding an easier install method, faster updates, a new UI, and proper Home Assistant update/repair notifications.</p>
<p>Home Assistant’s Community Store, HACS, has now hit v2.0, gaining some big improvements that continue to make it the best way to find, install, and update awesome community-made integrations and UI elements. This follows HACS being added as an <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a> collaboration partner, recognizing its important role in Home Assistant’s open ecosystem.</p>
<p>Just note, HACS is an advanced tool that can add custom code to your Home Assistant install, which can cause issues on your Home Assistant system. If you are a beginner or prioritize stability above all else, <a href="#how-to-install">HACS might not be for you</a>.</p>

<h2>HACS reaches v2.0</h2>
<p>This is one of the biggest updates yet for HACS, but if you’re not sure what HACS is or why you might consider using it, check out our <a href="#what-is-hacs">explainer below</a>.</p>
<h3>New frontend <!-- omit from toc --></h3>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-08-hacs2/frontend.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="HACS frontend looks like data tables">
<p>HACS 2.0 <a href="https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/repositories/dashboard/">main dashboard</a> has taken cues from Home Assistant, and now closely matches the native look and functionality of the data tables you find on the entities or automation pages. This includes the options to filter, group, sort, and search.</p>
<h3>Faster downloads <!-- omit from toc --></h3>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-08-hacs2/downloads.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="HDownload window going very fast">
<p>Previously, HACS 100% relied on GitHub to retrieve information, from file locations to the number of stars, so we needed to limit the API (as there are a lot of HACS users). To speed things up, we’ve created a <a href="https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/data_sources/">remote dataset</a> stored in Cloudflare R2 buckets, which are updated at regular intervals.  Files are still downloaded from GitHub and their API is still contacted, but it will see drastically fewer calls, and the speed improvement is massive. Behind the scenes, this was a big piece of work, which has ongoing costs, and shows the kind of support the Open Home Foundation can provide to a community-driven project like HACS.</p>

<img src='/images/blog/2024-08-hacs2/updates-repairs.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="update all your Home Assistant from the same place">
<p>No more visiting the HACS page every day to check for updates. They’ll now appear in the same places system and add-on <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/updates/">updates</a> appear in the native Home Assistant format. Also, once they’re finished updating, they will give you suggested repairs (for instance, reloading the dashboards or rebooting Home Assistant).</p>
<h3>Other improvements <!-- omit from toc --></h3>
<p>We have also renamed things to help them make more sense, including changing “category” to “type”, and “Lovelace” to “dashboard” (Lovelace needs to make room for <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#what-is-project-grace">Grace</a>). We’re also including Template management, which utilizes the new <a href="https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/publish/template/">template type</a> to enhance your Jinja templates.</p>

<p><strong>Breaking changes</strong> - There have been some breaking changes, such as removing the YAML configuration, no longer including the NetDaemon type, and moving <a href="https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/entities/switch/">beta selection to a switch entity</a>. Many of the changes are more likely to affect those sharing their code via HACS, check the <a href="https://github.com/hacs/integration/releases/tag/2.0.0">release notes for the full list</a>.</p>

<h2>What is HACS?</h2>
<p>Home Assistant is built around choice, and HACS is the epitome of this, giving you access to hundreds of community-made integrations, cards, themes, and more. HACS isn’t actually <em>a hack</em>, as Home Assistant has always allowed you to add custom integrations and UI elements - HACS just adds a streamlined interface to find, install, and update these.</p>
<p>HACS stands for <em>Home Assistant Community Store</em>, and despite the name it doesn’t sell anything - it’s all free and open-source. HACS is there for people in the community who write custom code to address something they think is missing from Home Assistant. It allows them to easily share this code with the community unrestricted via submitting their GitHub repository to HACS. This means these are maintained by the community members that upload them, not HACS or Home Assistant. If you want to learn more about what you’re installing, or report issues, there is always a link to the original code.  </p>
<p>Just to clear up the biggest misconception about HACS, <strong>it does not install add-ons</strong>. Home Assistant OS natively has its own <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_store/">built-in store for Home Assistant Add-ons</a>. Add-ons run alongside Home Assistant, while HACS installs custom code that can run in Home Assistant (which has implications for system stability, more on that below).</p>
<h2>Why use HACS?</h2>
<p><strong>More integrations</strong> - Not every device and service is supported by Home Assistant out-of-the-box, and HACS helps fill the gaps. There are hundreds of integrations on HACS, some are there because the authors didn’t have the time to meet Home Assistant’s requirements, while others are doing something not allowed by Home Assistant, like web scraping (which is sometimes the only way, but <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/issues/252">not a good idea</a>). Just be aware that these decisions can come at the expense of stability.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced integrations</strong> - Some HACS integrations are more complex and advanced versions of their Core counterparts, while other integrations combine multiple sensors to provide new data points. Some of these “integrations” even give Home Assistant advanced new features and settings. It also allows for rapid development as it allows updates outside the Home Assistant refresh cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Cards and Themes</strong> - There are some amazing cards, UIs, and themes being built by community developers and designers - BTW if you’re one, <a href="/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/#process-how-can-we-work-together">our frontend team needs your help</a>. HACS has made the installation and updating of these designs very simple and quick.</p>
<p><strong>Scripts and Templates</strong> - This is the easiest way to share scripts and templates, while also adding the ability to push new improvements to users via updates.</p>
<h2>A Brief History of HACS</h2>
<p>HACS started in 2019 as my (<a href="https://github.com/ludeeus">Joakim Sørensen</a> ) third attempt to build a community store. It started small and quickly became the de facto standard, with so many talented community creators submitting their projects. The Home Assistant team was supportive from day one, and even as HACS gained hundreds of thousands of downloads, we all agreed it should remain an optional addition to Home Assistant. Giving users the choice to add new features to Home Assistant at the cost of stability.</p>
<p>I joined <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">Nabu Casa</a> in 2020, partly due to the work I did on HACS, but I was hired to work on Home Assistant more generally, not to work on HACS. Incidentally, I’m not the only developer working at Nabu Casa who got their start on HACS: <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">Paul Bottein</a>  on the frontend team built <a href="https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom">Mushroom Cards</a>, and  <a href="https://github.com/marcelveldt">Marcel van der Veldt</a> who currently supports Matter development built <a href="https://music-assistant.io/">Music Assistant</a>.</p>
<p>Over the years, I continued to work on HACS in my spare time, but there were always aspects of the original version that limited its ability to grow. Recently, the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a> reached out to make HACS a collaboration partner, and provided development support. Numerous people were brought in to support, from across Nabu Casa and the community, leading to the large list of improvements you see today.</p>
<p>Just before we released this big update, it passed 5,000 stars on GitHub! It’s the projects on HACS that make it what it is today, and I’d like to sincerely thank everyone who continues to contribute their code onto the store.</p>
<h2>How to install</h2>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>
  <p class="alert-content">
<p><strong>Proceed with caution</strong> - HACS is not for everyone.  If you’re a Home Assistant beginner or are looking for the most stable experience in your smart home, HACS is probably not for you. These are community-made projects that do not receive the same rigorous reviews required of projects submitted to Home Assistant. There may be projects that don’t work or, even worse, break your system. Unlike add-ons that run separately and alongside Home Assistant, HACS projects run their code directly in Home Assistant, which increases the chances of crashing or harming your system. Before using HACS, always make a <a href="https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/data/#creating-a-backup">backup of your system</a> and download that backup to another device.</p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>HACS should work on any up-to-date version of Home Assistant, it even runs on core installations. It also requires a GitHub account. If you already have HACS 1.X installed, perform a backup, go into HACS and then click the update button for HACS (note: if you update, there is no downgrading).</p>
<p>If you’re a Home Assistant OS user here is the installation method (If you’re not using our OS, <a href="https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/#to-download-hacs-core">visit this page</a>),</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make a <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/backup/">backup of your system</a> and download it to another device for safekeeping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the addon: Using <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhacs%2Faddons&amp;addon=cb646a50_get">this link</a>, add the HACS add-on repository, and install the add-on it links to, <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhacs%2Faddons&amp;addon=cb646a50_get"><img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg" alt="Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of an add-on." /></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start the add-on (no need to “start on boot”, you should only need to run this once).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the add-on’s “Log” and follow the instructions given there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once finished, reboot Home Assistant and navigate to the <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/devices/">devices page</a>. Add the integration HACS, and follow the instructions to link it with your GitHub account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>It’s installed, now what?</strong></em> Start downloading some custom integrations and UI elements. There are a lot of great community resources listing the best custom <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/projects/custom-integrations/47?ascending=false&amp;order=views">integrations</a>, <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/projects/frontend/34?ascending=false&amp;order=views">cards</a>, <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/projects/themes/29/l/top">themes</a>, and more.</p>
<h2>Conclusion <!-- omit from toc --></h2>
<p>There are too many people to thank in this blog who have helped the development of HACS over the years.  Thanks for submitting your projects, reporting issues, fixing code, and just using this funny little side project. Most important to this all, thanks to <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">Home Assistant Cloud subscribers</a>. They made this update possible, not only do they pay my salary, but they also fund the Open Home Foundation, whose support was critical.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-08-wwha-update/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Works with Home Assistant becomes part of the Open Home Foundation">Art by Clelia Rella</p>
<p>After two successful years of <a href="https://partner.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a>, we’re continuing our work to improve this program. With this in mind, the program will move to the non-profit organization that owns Home Assistant, the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, which will ensure it is always aligned with the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/about/">values of the Open Home</a>.</p>
<p>Read on to see how we’re making several small but important changes to add more clarity to the program, and ultimately working to build a better, larger hardware ecosystem of smart home devices.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>What is Works with Home Assistant</h2>
<p>When you want to add something to your smart home the choices can be daunting; we want stable, supported devices that are built on standards that last. We understood how hard it could be to navigate all this and <a href="/blog/2022/07/12/partner-program/">set up Works with Home Assistant in 2022</a>, clearly indicating to users which brands provided the best smart home experiences and will continue to do so into the future. While also encouraging brands to step up their openness, compatibility, and long-term support.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-08-wwha-update/wwha-company-logos.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Full list of Works with Home Assistant company logos"></p>
<p>This program has been quite successful and now includes seven companies, including <a href="/blog/2022/07/27/leviton-partner/">Leviton</a>, <a href="/blog/2022/10/13/third-reality-partner/">Third Reality</a>, <a href="/blog/2022/10/25/ultraloq-partner/">Ultraloq</a>, <a href="/blog/2022/10/26/jasco-partner/">Jasco</a>, <a href="/blog/2023/03/03/heltun-partner/">Heltun</a>, <a href="/blog/2023/04/11/homeseer-partner/">HomeSeer</a>, and  <a href="/blog/2023/12/07/homewizard-joins-works-with-home-assistant-program/">HomeWizard</a>. Our community regularly recommends the brands in this program, not only because they carry the “Works with” logo but because they just work. This seamless operation is because Nabu Casa tests devices and works with the brand to ensure their software meets our requirements to provide what we consider to be the best Home Assistant experience. They also guarantee when joining that they will address issues and maintain support with Home Assistant over time.</p>
<p>We have had lots of positive feedback from the brands in the program. First off, if you’re already doing things right, i.e. focusing on local control, supporting users, and keeping software compatible, it’s relatively easy to join. It is also significantly more affordable compared to other partner programs. We want to connect our users to good hardware and help reward the brands that make the right decisions: win-win.</p>
<h2>Open Home Foundation steps in</h2>
<p>This year we <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/blog/announcing-the-open-home-foundation/">announced the Open Home Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization that now owns and governs the Home Assistant project. It makes logical sense that Works with Home Assistant now sits alongside its parent organization, but there are other key benefits. Specifically, it is now clear that this program is not a commercial endeavor; it is solely here to encourage a better-supported hardware ecosystem for Home Assistant.</p>
<p>Nabu Casa, the commercial partner of the Open Home Foundation, previously successfully administered the program. By placing the program under the foundation, it provides another layer to ensure the program remains focused on its mission.</p>
<h2>The update</h2>
<p>While we’re making this shift from Nabu Casa to the Open Home Foundation, we’re also taking the opportunity to do some housekeeping, improving the program on several fronts.</p>
<p>From now on the program will be certifying individual devices instead of whole brands. Previously, an integration was approved for Works with Home Assistant, and all devices that could work with the integration could fall under the program. By making testing and certification device-specific, it becomes much clearer to users which devices they can purchase with confidence. We will soon start listing devices that have been certified specifically.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-08-wwha-update/wwha-badges.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Full list of Works with Home Assistant badges">No brands have used the Cloud badge before, so no one is affected by its removal.</p>
<p>The cloud badge has been discontinued and this is due to our belief, and observation, that all <a href="https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/all-cloud-based-products-will-come-to-an-end/">cloud-based products are always doomed to stop working</a>, some sooner than others. Considering the <a href="https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/all-cloud-based-products-will-come-to-an-end/#:~:text=How%20not%20to%20phase%20out%20cloud%2Dbased%20products">cases over the past year</a> of cloud-based devices becoming useless after the cloud service they depended on was shut down, and the lengths needed to keep them somewhat functional, we no longer believe the Works with Home Assistant promise can be upheld by cloud-based devices.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We want to see Works with Home Assistant continue to grow, ultimately covering every smart home device category, allowing for a home completely made of products that will give the best experience. We’d recommend users to always consider these products first, and also encourage more brands to <a href="https://partner.home-assistant.io/">get in touch to join</a>. Let’s build a more open hardware ecosystem together.</p>

<h2>Dashboards - Chapter 2</h2>
<p>As part of our <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#dashboards">roadmap</a>, work has
continued on making dashboard customization and organization easier and more
intuitive.</p>
<p>Last week, we had the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zmXLxQPr1o">“Dashboards Chapter 2”</a>
live stream, talking about the current state of the dashboards, the progress
we have made, the upcoming features, and improvements we are working on, but
more importantly: The great insights in all our research and the design philosophy
behind the dashboards. In case you missed it, you can watch the 1-hour recording
on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zmXLxQPr1o">YouTube channel</a> or
read the <a href="/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/">recap blog post</a>.</p>
<p>As part of our continuous improvement, this month we have fully redesigned
and revamped the badges for your dashboards!</p>
<h3>New badges for your dashboard</h3>
<p>We already wrote about it extensively in our <a href="/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/#new-badges">Dashboard Chapter 2 blog post</a>
and this release introduces our redesigned badges!</p>
<p>This is a big revamp of the original badges that have been in Home Assistant
since, well, forever. The new badges are designed to match the design of the
<a href="https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom">Mushroom</a> chip cards, and are meant to sit at the top of a dashboard view,
providing a summary of the most important information that you need to know
at a glance.</p>
<img src="/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/new-badges.png" alt="New badges sitting on top of a dashboard view!">
<p>These new badges match the functionality of the previous design but are
now even more feature-rich. Of course, they are fully configurable from the UI,
allowing you to tweak them to your needs. You can specify whether the icon,
name, and/or state will be visible, and you can configure the contents within
each of them.</p>
<p>Everything can, of course, be dragged and dropped in the order you like 😎</p>
<p>Not just that, the new badges also come with visibility options, the same
as we have <a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#control-visibility-of-cards">introduced for cards in Home Assistant 2024.6</a>.
This means you can show or hide them based on who is viewing the dashboard, what
screen size it is displayed within, whether an entity is in a certain state,
and more.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/badges-add-visibility.png" alt="Screenshots; left showing the add badge dialog wich include the custom mushroom template badge, on the right shows the visibility tab and options badges now have.">
<p>The best news of all? The new badges work across both the new sections view and
the old masonry view! 🎉 Heck!, we even have support for custom badges, like the
custom template one released by the <a href="https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom">Mushroom</a> project 🍄.</p>
<p>If you have existing old-style badges today, don’t worry! They will be
automatically converted to the new badges when you upgrade to this release.</p>
<h3>Optimized information density for the Sections view</h3>
<p>For this release, we have also fine-tuned the design grid for our
<a href="/dashboards/sections/">experimental Sections view</a>.</p>
<p>The height of each row has been reduced, allowing more information to be
displayed on the screen. Hours of pixel pushing have also reduced the gap
between the <a href="/dashboards/tile/">Tile card</a> contents and its
<a href="/dashboards/features/">features</a>, resulting in a cleaner and more
uniform appearance.</p>
<p class="img">
<img src="/images/blog/2024-08/optimized-information-density.png" alt="Screenshot showing the difference between the previous and current release.">
The 2024.7 release on the left and this 2024.8 release on the right.
</p>
<p>If you have been experimenting with sections and have resized some of your
cards, you may need to readjust the sizes to accommodate these changes.</p>
<h2>Goodbye service calls, hello actions 👋</h2>
<p>This release marks an important milestone in the evolution of Home Assistant:
we are saying goodbye to <strong>service calls</strong> and hello to <strong>actions</strong>!</p>
<p>If you are a long-time user of Home Assistant reading this now: don’t be alarmed
by this change, nothing breaks with this, and everything will continue to work
just as it did before.</p>
<p>In the 2024.1 release, we <a href="/2024/01/03/release-20241/#unified-actions">unified the actions</a>
in the Home Assistant <span class='terminology'>automation<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Automations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> &amp; script editors. The goal of
that change was to make our automation editor easier for newer users to
understand by removing the “Service call” layer and terminology.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-01/add-action-search.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new add action dialog utilizing the search function to find whatever you need.">
<p>The above screenshot shows the UI that has been in use since the <a href="/2024/01/03/release-20241/">January release</a>,
and was very well received in general. However, the underlying terminology
in our documentation and all other places in Home Assistant still used the
“service call” terminology.</p>
<p>Additionally, the term “services” in Home Assistant is overloaded and ambiguous.
It is used for both the services you can call in Home Assistant and services you
might integrate with, like weather or music services. In the latter case, we
are talking about integrating with a service provided by a program or website,
which is referenced in our Settings page as <strong>Devices &amp; services</strong>. 😵‍💫</p>
<p>To make things clearer, we are now changing the terminology around
<em>service calls</em> in Home Assistant from “services” to “actions” <strong>everywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>Every occurrence in the documentation, the UI, the code, and everywhere else
in Home Assistant, has been replaced with “action”. Unlike the previous services
which were “called”, actions are “performed”.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/actions-developers-tools.png" alt="Screenshot of the developers tools, which also renamed all occurances of services to actions.">
<div class="alert alert-important">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:message-alert-outline'></iconify-icon> Important</p>
  <p class="alert-content">
<p>If you write automations in YAML, you will notice that the <code>service</code> key
in your actions is now called <code>action</code>. For example:</p>
<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="yaml"><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">action</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">light.turn_on</span>
  <span class="na">target</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">area</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">living_room</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Existing UI-managed automations will be automatically converted the next time they
are edited and saved. If you write automation in YAML, you can
use either <code>action</code> or <code>service</code>, as this change is fully backward compatible,
but we recommend using <code>action</code> from now on.</p>
  </p>
</div>
<h2>Sort data tables by created or last modified</h2>
<p>You’ve added a new integration, a new device, or maybe just updated
Home Assistant and wondering what new entities or devices you have available?</p>
<p>This release will help you with that. Home Assistant now tracks when entities
and devices, and many other things were created or last modified. If these are
shown in a table, it means you can now sort them by the date they were created
or last modified; helping you find those recently added or modified items.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/data-tables-created-modified-columns-sorting.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new created and modified columns of the entities table, allowing one to sort on these new values.">
<p>The created and modified columns are hidden by default, but you can make them
visible by clicking the <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:cog' title='Cog'></iconify-icon> icon at the top right of the
table. Sorting is always available, regardless of the columns’ visibility.</p>
<p>You might notice that most entities and devices do not have this created or
modified data populated yet. Well this data has only started being recorded in
this release, and cannot be applied retroactively, but going forward it should
only get more useful.</p>
<h2>Control Home Assistant using AI with Ollama</h2>
<p>In the 2024.6 release, we introduced the ability to use the <a href="/integrations/openai_conversation">OpenAI</a> and
<a href="/integrations/google_generative_ai_conversation/">GoogleAI</a> <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> to <a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#dipping-our-toes-in-the-world-of-ai-using-llms">control your home using Large Language Models</a>
(LLMs). Many of you requested this to work with a local hosted LLM as well.</p>
<p>Today we are happy to announce that Home Assistant now supports
control via local LLMs too!</p>
<p>This is achieved thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Shulyaka">@Shulyaka</a> adding support for the brand new tools
API in Ollama. The performance of the local models has been fine tuned by
<a href="https://github.com/AllenPorter">@AllenPorter</a>.</p>
<p>Allen created a new <a href="https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports#assist-mini">LLM benchmark suite</a> that is more balanced, less focused
on edge cases, and uses fewer exposed entities. We scored the different models
with this new benchmark, and the cloud-based models scored 98%, but local LLMs
did not do nearly as well.</p>
<p>Through prompt tuning and fixes included in this release, we have gotten local
LLMs to score a reasonable 84%. We will continue to test new models while
improving our prompts and tools to achieve a higher score.</p>
<p class="img">

Overview of performance of Ollama running different local models ran against the <a href="https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports#assist-mini">LLM benchmark suite</a>.
</p>
<p>If you want to experiment with local LLMs using Home Assistant, we currently
recommend using the Llama 3.1 8B model and exposing fewer than 25 entities. Note
that smaller models are more likely to make mistakes.</p>

integrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy
changes to existing integrations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/homekit">HomeKit Bridge</a> integration now supports the event entities representing
doorbells and motion sensors. Big thanks <a href="https://github.com/bdraco">@bdraco</a>!</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>UE Smart Radio</strong> has been removed; the service has been <a href="https://forums.slimdevices.com/forum/user-forums/general-discussion/1668327-uesmartradio-com-and-mysqueezebox-com-servers">discontinued</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA) updates</h2>
<p>The <a href="/integrations/zha">Zigbee Home Automation</a> (ZHA) got a massive overhaul this release!</p>
<p>What this means for you? Well… basically: <em><strong>nothing</strong></em>! And this sounds odd,
but that is a good thing!</p>
<p>The whole integration has been split into a separate codebase, making it
easier to maintain and improve. This is a huge step forward for the integration,
and took months of work to get done.</p>
<p>You will not notice anything different right now, but this change will make the
integration easier to maintain and improve in the future, including allowing
code contributors to contribute more easily.</p>
<p>Thanks for the dedication and the huge amounts of hard work on this integration
<a href="https://github.com/dmulcahey">@dmulcahey</a>, <a href="https://github.com/puddly">@puddly</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/TheJulianJES">@TheJulianJES</a>! 🥰</p>
<h2>Matter updates</h2>
<p>There are a couple of updates for the Matter integration this release, while we
are working hard to get the integration ready for official Matter certification.</p>
<p>The Matter integration can now provide update entities. If your Matter device
has a firmware update available, Home Assistant will now be able to inform you
about it and update the device for you. 🎉</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-08/matter-updates.png" alt="Screenshot showing an firmware update for an Matter device being able and can be installed straight from the Home Assistant UI."></p>
<p>This update feature is available for all Matter devices, where manufacturers
provide firmware updates via the official Matter update channels. Not many
manufacturers are involved in delivering these updates yet, but this is a great
step forward, and we hope many manufacturers using Matter will follow this
example.</p>
<p>Event entities provided by the Matter integration have been improved. They
will now provide more event types, allowing you to react to things like single
press or double press events with ease.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/jvmahon">@jvmahon</a> contributed support for select entities to the Matter
integration. This is used to select modes if your Matter device supports them,
such as laundry, oven, or dishwasher modes.</p>
<p>These last two features, are amazing improvements to the Matter integration,
but they are mainly a highlight. Many Matter device types have seen improvements,
including more (configuration) entities and other improvements.</p>
<h2>KNX can now be managed via the UI</h2>
<p>The <a href="/integrations/knx">KNX integration</a> introduces the ability to manage entities directly from the
UI. 🎉</p>
<p>If you have an ETS project file, configuring your devices is now more
intuitive; you can easily select an actuator from the side panel and drag and
drop its assigned group addresses into the configuration. Alternatively,
addresses can be found by name or number using dropdown menus.</p>
<p>Create, update, and delete KNX switch and light entities directly from the KNX
panel without touching any YAML. 😎</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-08/knx-panel-for-creating-entities.png" alt="Screenshot showing the KNX panel that allows to create entities right from the UI."></p>
<p>More improvements have been made under the hood. One of the most notable changes
is the support for a broader range of Data Point Type (DPT) definitions. These
can be used directly within actions and triggers and inspected
in the KNX GroupMonitor.</p>
<p>Thank you for working so hard on this one <a href="https://github.com/farmio">@farmio</a>; this is awesome! 🥰</p>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are proud of our <a href="https://openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, so we will now show its pretty
logo on the Home Assistant loading and information screens. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a>!</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#timers-are-here">Timer support</a> using <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a> for mobile devices. This means you can now
control timers from your mobile device or tablet. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a>!</li>
<li>You can now ask <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a> for the current time and date, thanks <a href="https://github.com/synesthesiam">@synesthesiam</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/synesthesiam">@synesthesiam</a> also switched our voice activity detection to <a href="https://github.com/rhasspy/pymicro-vad">microVAD</a>!
Using this we are able to detect the end of a speech command much better
in noisy environments, even with music in the background. Cool!</li>
<li>The <a href="/dashboards/picture-elements/">picture elements card</a> can now be fully managed in the UI using a
brand-new visual editor. Fantastic work there <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>!</li>
<li>Home Assistant will now raise a repair issue if a script can’t be set up
(for example, because of YAML syntax errors). Thanks <a href="https://github.com/emontnemery">@emontnemery</a>!</li>
<li>If Home Assistant finds an integration set up that has been removed
(like when you remove a custom integration), it will now raise a repair issue
to help you clean up anything left behind. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">@joostlek</a>!</li>
<li><a href="/integrations/group">Group</a> now has support for grouping two new entity types. <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">@joostlek</a> added
support for grouping <a href="/integrations/notify">notify</a> entities, and <a href="https://github.com/frenck">@frenck</a> added support for grouping
<a href="/integrations/button">button</a> entities. Nice!</li>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/generic_thermostat">Generic Thermostat</a> and <a href="/integrations/generic_hygrostat">Hygrostat</a> helpers will now be linked to the
device that provided the actuator entity, thanks <a href="https://github.com/dougiteixeira">@dougiteixeira</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gjohansson-ST">@gjohansson-ST</a> did the same, he added a link to the <a href="/integrations/history_stats">History stats</a> helper
to the device that provided the sensor entity.</li>
<li>You can now set up <a href="/integrations/button">button</a>, <a href="/integrations/image">image</a>, <a href="/integrations/select">select</a>, and <a href="/integrations/switch">switch</a> templates
entities, straight from the UI. Awesome job <a href="https://github.com/dougiteixeira">@dougiteixeira</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a> added a button to the actions developer tools to copy the action
response as JSON for use in templates. Nice!</li>
<li>The <a href="/dashboards/picture/">picture</a>, <a href="/dashboards/picture-elements/">picture elements</a>, <a href="/dashboards/picture-entity/">picture entity</a>, and <a href="/dashboards/picture-glance/">picture glance</a> cards
can now get their image from the person entity! You don’t need to set a static
image to represent a person, it will now automatically fetch the person’s picture
for you. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/Quentame">@Quentame</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Integrations and helpers set up via YAML, now visible in the UI!</h2>
<p>Most popular <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> and helpers can be set up directly from the
Home Assistant user interface. However, we still have a lot of older or less
used integrations that can only be set up using <a href="/docs/configuration/yaml/">manual YAML configuration</a>.
We are working hard to move <a href="#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui">more and more of these integrations to the UI</a>,
however, this takes time and effort.</p>
<p>The problem with these integrations is that they are not visible in the UI
when they are set up using YAML. What we often see is that someone sets up
an integration using YAML and then cannot see it on the integrations page,
often resulting in questions in our community about where to find it.</p>
<p>As of this release, we have drastically improved this situation. All integrations,
regardless of how they are set up, are now visible on the integrations page
in the UI. This means that even if you set up an integration using YAML,
you can now find it in the UI and view its provided entities.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/yaml-integration-listed.png" alt="Screenshot showing the demo integration, which is set up manually via YAML, showing up in the UI on the integrations dashboard.">
<p>Integrations originating from manual YAML configuration can be recognized by the
<iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:file-code-outline' title='File code outline'></iconify-icon> icon showing on their cards.</p>
<p>Similarly, we also have <a href="/integrations/#helper">many helpers</a> that can be set up
using YAML configuration. These sometimes showed up in the UI, but often did not.
We have adjusted this as well, and made sure that all helpers are now visible
in the UI, regardless of how they are set up.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>
  <p class="alert-content">
<p>Things set up manually using YAML are still managed using YAML. This means that
if you want to change the configuration of these integrations or helpers, you
will need to do so in the YAML configuration files.</p>
  </p>
</div>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.8 in August. These
patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch every

<h2>Backward-incompatible changes</h2>
<p>We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.</p>
<p>We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:</p>

    <div class='details-block-content' id="content_0">
<p>This notice applies only if you use the recorder integration with a MySQL or
PostgreSQL database. If you are using the default SQLite database,
you can ignore it.</p>
<p>This release includes a database upgrade/migration that increases the size of
the number we can store for the identifier fields. For a more technical
explanation, we are upgrading integer fields for ID columns from a 32-bit
integer to <code>BIGINT</code>, which is a 64-bit integer.</p>
<p>This can cause the database upgrade to take longer than usual, depending on
the size of your database.</p>
<p>Please be patient and let the upgrade process finish. Do not interrupt the
upgrade process, as this can lead to a corrupted database.</p>

    <updated>2024-08-01T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/08/01/streamlining-the-home-assistant-yellow-lineup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-08-yellow-lineup/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Home Assistant Yellow and packaging">Home Assistant Yellow fully assembled with additional (and not included) NVMe storage and Z-Wave GPIO module</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>  We will now only sell the Home Assistant Yellow as a kit, which requires the separate purchase of a CM4. Home Assistant Green is the best plug-and-play option for beginners.</p>
<p>An important part of getting more people to use Home Assistant is providing great purpose-built hardware. It’s our goal to provide hardware that makes it easier than ever to start with Home Assistant, along with compelling options for advanced users.  In 2022, we began shipping our <a href="/yellow/">Home Assistant Yellow</a>, and I’m happy to say that now in 2024, it remains our flagship hardware product.  We see a long life ahead for this expandable little powerhouse, and that’s why we’re streamlining our hardware lineup to make a bit more sense going forward.</p>
<p>We will now only sell the Home Assistant Yellow as a kit and have stopped producing the Home Assistant Yellow Standard (our version that came preassembled with a CM4 and Home Assistant already installed). Rest assured, as the Home Assistant Yellow Standard’s hardware is identical to our kits, it will continue to receive the same support and software updates. The kits will continue to be available with or without power-over-ethernet (PoE).</p>
<p>It’s not the biggest change, but we wanted our community to know - and if you want to see why we made the change, and how our <a href="#comparison">current hardware compares</a>, keep reading.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>When we launched Home Assistant Yellow, we designed it with expandability in mind.  It includes an onboard Zigbee/Thread radio, M.2 for more robust storage, and USB ports to add more connectivity (like adding our future <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#next-priority-home-assistant-connect-hardware-for-z-wave">Z-Wave device</a>).  Most importantly, you can change the core specs of the device by swapping the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4).  This allows users to increase the RAM, add eMMC storage, or even add built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.</p>
<p>All this expandability is great, but we found many users wanted a more straightforward way to get started with Home Assistant. That’s why we created the Home Assistant Yellow Standard variant, which included a CM4 with Home Assistant already installed onto the board - unlike our kits there was no assembly required. This meant you could immediately start using it after plugging in Ethernet and power.</p>
<h3>Green meets Yellow</h3>
<p>Jump ahead to 2023, and in our quest to create an even more affordable starting point, we launched <a href="/green/">Home Assistant Green</a>. Not only does it cost less, it better fulfills the plug-and-play role the Home Assistant Yellow Standard used to occupy. From a timing perspective 2021 and 2022, were not the easiest time to source Raspberry Pi products, including the CM4. We learned some big lessons about the added supply chain complexities of this kind of product, and it influenced our thinking when designing Green. Ultimately, Home Assistant Green being a better beginner option led us to end production of the Standard. Though the Home Assistant Yellow Standard is now out of stock at major retailers, it will continue to receive support.</p>
<h2>Comparison</h2>

</p>
<p>We have been steadily shipping updates to our new dashboard design every month since we announced <a href="/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#what-is-project-grace">Project Grace</a>, and our new grid system is finally maturing to a point where we would like our community of contributors to get involved!</p>
<p>If you are a UX/UI designer or a custom card developer who would like to contribute to the Home Assistant project, <a href="/join-dashboard-group">sign up to be part of our dashboard working group</a> and read more about what you can do to improve compatibility of your custom cards.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>What’s new since the last chapter?</h2>
<p>Thanks to your feedback, we continued to build upon the grid system and the sections layout with features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2024/04/03/release-20244/#define-the-columns-in-the-section-view">Max column option for sections</a> (2024.4)</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2024/05/01/release-20245/#reorder-features-of-the-tile-card">Drag and drop for card features</a> (2024.5)</li>

</ul>
<p>Check out the corresponding blogs for more details.</p>
<h3>New badges!</h3>
<p>In the upcoming 2024.8, we are introducing our redesigned <a href="/dashboards/badges/">badges</a>.</p>
<p>The original badges was created as far back as <a href="/blog/2015/08/31/version-7-revamped-ui-and-improved-distribution/">version 0.7</a> in August 2015, and its design has not changed much since. Designed to sit at the top of a dashboard view, badges provide a summary of the most important information that you need to know, at a glance.</p>
<p>According to our case studies of dashboards created by our users, we found that these badges are underused, mainly due to its outmoded appearance, bulky size, and the lack of configurable options from the UI. Instead, we found that many users are using <a href="https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/blob/main/docs/cards/chips.md">Mushroom Chip cards</a>, created by <a href="https://github.com/pittaya">@piitaya</a> who also works at Nabu Casa, for similar purposes. Therefore, we decided to redesign our badges to match the design of the Mushroom Chip cards.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/new-badges.png" alt="New badges sitting on top of a dashboard view!" /></p>
<p>The new badges feature a wide range of configurable options from the UI. For each individual badge, you can now specify whether the icon, name, and/or state will be visible, and you can configure the contents within each of these components: States can include multiple attributes to be displayed, and icons can be replaced with the entity picture for a person’s avatar or a media_player’s record cover.</p>
<p>Visibility options are also available for the new badges, which allow you to show or hide them based on who is viewing the dashboard, what screen size it is displayed within, whether an entity is in a certain state, and more.</p>
<p>Badges can be easily reordered with drag-and-drop, and they also come with copy, paste, and duplicate features that cards in the new sections view have. Last but not least, the new badges work across both the new sections view and the old masonry view.</p>
<h4>Notes for card developers</h4>
<p>On a default installation, we offer one built-in badge, the entity badge. However, you are not limited to that, as you can build and use your own!
Defining a badge is done in a very similar way to defining a custom card. For more information, check out <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-badge">our developer documentations</a>.</p>
<p>We would love to see your new creations - perhaps a small sparkline graph, or how about a mini progress bar? What do users want to quickly find out on a dashboard at a glance, and what can you display in this small amount of space to get the message across? Let your creativity go wild!</p>
<h2>What’s next for Dashboards?</h2>
<p>As the new sections view matures in its featureset, we want to begin our focus on a bigger task: to revamp all the dashboard cards and bring them up to modern standards. To achieve this, we need you - the power of our contributor community!</p>
<h3>How can we achieve this?</h3>
<p>Once upon a time (I mean, Summer of 2018), <a href="/blog/2018/06/22/release-72/">a group of developers came together to create the Lovelace dashboard</a>. It was built organically - developers contributed where they see a need, either for replicating a feature from the previous States UI, or for adding something that they use personally. While the cards that come with Lovelace are adequate, the usability and aesthetics left much to be improved. In order to raise the bar in our design standards, we need more design-minded contributors.</p>
<p>Enter (semi) open-source design.</p>
<p>Traditionally, open-source projects are built around code repositories such as GitHub. This allows easy submission of contributions by anyone who can code. We figured that we may be able to achieve the same for product direction and UX design, too.</p>
<p>However, it is not easy to start with a blank canvas, and designers and developers have different workflows. Therefore, as the maintainers of the Home Assistant project, we are providing the product goals, the base design framework, and the process to facilitate collaboration.</p>
<h3>Product goals: What do we want to achieve?</h3>
<p>The goal of Project Grace is to make customization and organization of dashboards easy and intuitive for all users in a household. Dashboards are created to help users monitor and control smart homes, and as cards are the building blocks of dashboards, by extension, cards should also achieve the same product goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitor</strong>: Allow users to monitor the states of the device and service entities, with data visualizations that are easy and quick to understand.</li>
<li><strong>Control</strong>: Allow users to control the devices in their smart homes, mainly with touch screens, and on the desktop with a mouse occasionally.</li>
</ul>
<p>To bring them up to modern standards, we want you to join us to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revamp existing cards to fit the new grid system.</strong> This will achieve the modularity and ease of customization we are looking to achieve with the sections view.</li>
<li><strong>Standardize the design system.</strong> The new cards should adhere to the same design tokens for typography, iconography, shapes, dimensions, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Create new cards.</strong> This will fill the current feature gaps that we have not addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Extend existing cards with card features.</strong> Card features allow every card to be more modular and be always up-to-date.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate existing popular cards on HACS.</strong> This will reduce the need to install custom cards and also bring them up to the UX standards of the Home Assistant frontend.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design framework: What will our card designs be based upon?</h3>
<h4>The grid system</h4>
<p>The new cards will be based on the <a href="/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#the-grid-system">design grid system</a> as defined previously, finalized with a few tweaks for better information density and aesthetics. We have reduced the height of each row on the grid to eliminate the empty space between the card contents and card features:</p>
<p class='text-center'><img src='/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/card-size-comparison.png' style='width: 66%;' alt='Comparison of the old and new grid dimensions effect on cards'></p>
<p>The finalized grid dimensions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Row height: 66px → 56px</li>
<li>Gutter: 8px</li>
<li>Icon size: 40px → 36px</li>
<li>Feature height : 40px → 42px</li>
</ul>
<p class='text-center'><img src='/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/grid-dimensions.png' alt='Grid size dimensions'></p>
<h4>Design guidelines</h4>
<p>We have also researched on the design of the Tile card, and here are some of the guidelines we have deduced from the research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each card used for controls should have a clear primary action.</li>
<li>Affordance: Everything that is designed to invite users to interact with should look clickable.</li>
<li>Features get better results than icon buttons.</li>
<li>Don’t clutter up the card.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the rest of the design system, we have been gradually moving towards Material 3 for the past year, but we have yet to finalize and adapt it fully on our frontend. We would like to hear your input on how we can bring it to our cards.</p>
<h3>Process: How can we work together?</h3>
<p>Since open-source design is not attempted often, there are not a lot of precedents we can refer to. We are experimenting with our process and will tweak it as we learn more. For now, we come up with the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Working group, assemble!</strong> If you are an UX designer, product person, or a frontend developer, you are welcomed to <a href="/join-dashboard-group">sign up</a> to be part of the dashboard working group! We pick based on experience in dashboard and card design and development.</li>
<li><strong>Meet and greet.</strong> We will organize introduction workshops where everyone comes together to learn about what we can offer and define our project goals.</li>
<li><strong>Start small.</strong> We will parcel out each individual card as a project. We will start with the easier cards first. Every working group member can work on as many cards as they like.</li>
<li><strong>Research and design.</strong> We will quickly research, ideate, prototype, and validate our designs together, and share our designs and work-in-progress live on Figma.</li>
<li><strong>Let’s build it!</strong> We will clean up and finalize our designs, develop the cards, and launch the new cards with the next HA release!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Action items: What can you do as a custom card developer now?</h3>
<p>If you have already created some custom cards, this is a great time to start upgrading your work to the next level!</p>
<h4>1. Fit your custom card into grid system</h4>
<p>In order for your custom card to work well with the sections view, you need to specify the default, minimum, and maximum width and height of your card:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default</strong> width and height is the size of the card when it is first added to the dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum</strong> width and height is the size of the card when its content cannot shrink further in size to adapt to and be usable with the provided area.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum</strong> width and height is the size of the card when its content cannot expand further in size to adapt to and be usable with the provided area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our grid system has a fixed row height, which means that you can estimate how many rows your card will need by dividing the height of your card by the sum of the row height and the gutter.</p>
<p>For more information on how you can implement the card resizing logic, check out our <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-card#sizing-in-sections-view">developer documentation</a>.</p>
<h4>2. Follow usability guidelines from our user research</h4>
<p>Audit the usability of your custom card with <a href="#design-guidelines">the guidelines</a> as mentioned above.</p>
<h4>3. Create new card features</h4>
<p class='text-center'><img src='https://developers.home-assistant.io/assets/images/dashboard-custom-card-feature-screenshot-8425524ea32eb5d4744a7557fcfcab33.png' alt='Card feature example'></p>
<p>Card features are widgets that can be placed inside cards for displaying or controlling an attribute of the entity. By building <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-card-feature">custom card features</a>, you can expand the abilities of many cards that support card features. You can also allow your custom card to use card features, similar to what we had done to the [Thermostat card].</p>
<h4>4. Ensure features are editable in UI</h4>
<p class='text-center'><img src='/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/card-visual-editor-example.png' style='width: 50%;' alt='Example of a visual editor for a card'></p>
<p>The inclusion of a <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-card-feature">visual editor</a>  is key to the ease of use of your custom cards, allowing more people to be able to edit and use them on their dashboards. Be sure to include only the necessary options in the visual editor, while also hide away the less used options in YAML or in an accordion UI to avoid clutter.</p>

<p>Home Assistant 2024.7! 🎉</p>
<p>Get ready for a really nice release with something interesting for everyone! 🤗</p>
<p>And not just that, I bring you these release notes from our refreshed website 🤩
that <a href="https://github.com/Madelena">Madelena</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frenck">yours truly</a> have been spontaneously working on over the
past few days. We hope you like it! ❤️</p>
<p>Some fantastic additions to <a href="/voice_control">Assist</a>: Timers!
and the ability to expose your scripts to LLMs. In case you missed it,
it has been covered and demonstrated live in our recent
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLLO4u2Tbbo">Voice - Chapter 7 livestream!</a>
which you definitely should watch. 📺</p>
<p>The <a href="/dashboards/sections/">sections view</a> becomes more feature-rich with
every release, and this time, the <a href="#resize-the-cards-on-your-dashboard">ability to resize cards</a>
is added. Absolutely the highlight of the release for me!</p>
<p>My second favorite highlight for this release is the ability to
<a href="#take-control-of-blueprint-based-automations">take control of blueprint-based automations</a>.
There are so many <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/blueprints-exchange/53/l/top?period=yearly">amazing blueprints out there</a>,
and many are perfect, but sometimes they fit 90% of what you need. Being able
to take control of that last 10% is just amazing!</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>Resize the cards on your dashboard</h2>
<p>As <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#dashboards">part of our roadmap</a>, we’re
continuing to make dashboard organization and customization easier and more
intuitive. This month, we add the ability to <a href="/dashboards/cards/#resizing-a-card">resize the cards</a> on your
dashboard!</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/dashboard-resize-cards-example.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing several cards at different sizes.'>
<p>Resizing is done with a very nice slider interface, found in the card editing
menu under the new <strong>Layout</strong> tab, where you can preview your changes. Make
small 1x1 buttons or give a <a href="/dashboards/map/">map</a> the space it needs. This is only available on
our experimental <a href="/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#a-new-experimental-sections-view">sections view</a>, which was recently released with drag-and-drop.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/dashboard-resize-card.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing the card edit diaglog, with the new layout tag and its card resize capabilities.'>
<p>It works with <a href="/dashboards/cards/">every card</a>, which gives users a lot of freedom. Most cards have
been given a built-in minimum and maximum size, to make it easier to get your
layouts just right. If you mess up the look of a card, luckily we have included
a revert button <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:restore' title='Restore'></iconify-icon> in the
top left corner 😉.</p>
<h2>Data tables improvements</h2>
<p>Like the <a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#data-tables-improvements">last release</a> and <a href="/blog/2024/05/01/release-20245/#more-features-for-our-data-tables">release before that</a>, we keep improving our data
tables. We use data tables to organize information in our settings pages,
including our devices and automations pages.</p>
<p>With this release, we add the final big piece of the puzzle: The ability to
customize the columns shown! 😎</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/data-tables-customize-columns.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing the dialog that allow customizing the order and visibility of data table columns available on the device page.'>
<p>By selecting the cog <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:cog' title='Cog'></iconify-icon> in
the top right, you can not only customize the columns shown by toggling
visibility <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:eye' title='Eye'></iconify-icon>, but you
can also change the order of the columns by
dragging <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:drag' title='Drag'></iconify-icon> them around.
Making it even easier to show the data you want, in the order you want it.</p>
<p>Your customized columns and view are stored in your browser, so you only have
to set them up once. They will be remembered the next time you visit the page.</p>
<h2>Voice &amp; Assist</h2>
<p>This month, we’re thrilled to bring more enhancements to <a href="/voice_control/">Assist’s</a> out-of-the-box
capabilities. We’ve added support for timers ⏲️ — our third most requested
feature for voice control — and the powerful ability to expose your
<span class='terminology'>scripts<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Scripts are components that allow users to specify a sequence of actions to be executed by Home Assistant when turned on.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/scripts/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> to LLMs (like <a href="/integrations/openai_conversation/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="/integrations/google_generative_ai_conversation">Google Gemini</a>) as well! 💪</p>
<p>If you missed it, be sure to check out our recent Voice - Chapter 7 livestream
from June 26th, where we showcased all these exciting developments. You can
<a href="/blog/2024/06/26/voice-chapter-7/">read more in our blog post here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLLO4u2Tbbo">watch the full livestream on YouTube</a>. 🎙️</p>
<h3>Timers are here!</h3>
<p>You asked, and we listened! As of this release, timers are available. This
feature allows you to create, cancel, pause, resume, and adjust timers using
your voice, making everyday tasks like cooking much easier. And yes, you can
set multiple timers at once! 🎉</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2024/06/26/voice-chapter-7/#timers-are-here">Read more about timers in the Chapter 7 blog post</a>.</p>
<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid="v3mNdTsX4J0" videotitle="Voice timers with countdown text and loading bar"></lite-youtube>Timers running on an S3 Box, with countdown text and a loading bar!</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>
  <p class="alert-content">
<p>Timers are available today on <a href="https://esphome.io/projects/">ESPHome</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-satellite">Wyoming voice satellites</a>.
To take advantage of this new feature, update these devices to the latest
version.</p>
  </p>
</div>
<h3>Expand an LLM using your scripts</h3>
<p>You can now expand LLM capabilities by allowing them access to (your choice)
of your <span class='terminology'>scripts<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Scripts are components that allow users to specify a sequence of actions to be executed by Home Assistant when turned on.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/scripts/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>. This feature lets you precisely control what the
LLM does in specific situations, while still benefiting from the flexibility
and natural language processing that AIs excel at.</p>
<p>For example, you can create a <em>“leaving home”</em> script that performs the actions
you want and <a href="/voice_control/voice_remote_expose_devices/">expose it to Assist</a>. This ensures that commands like
<em>“I’m heading out for a couple of minutes”</em> will run your predefined script,
such as locking the door without turning off the air conditioning.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2024/06/26/voice-chapter-7/#expand-an-llm-with-scripts">Read more about expanding LLMs with script in the Chapter 7 blog post</a>.</p>
<h2>Take control of blueprint-based automations</h2>
<p><span class='terminology'>Blueprints<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A blueprint is a script, automation or template entity configuration with certain parts marked as configurable. This allows users to create multiple scripts, automations or template entities based on the same blueprint, with each having its own configuration-specific settings.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/blueprint/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are amazing; they allow you to use <span class='terminology'>automations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Automations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>
and <span class='terminology'>scripts<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Scripts are components that allow users to specify a sequence of actions to be executed by Home Assistant when turned on.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/scripts/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> created and shared by other awesome Home Assistant users.
Most are easy to use and set up, but what if that great blueprint you’ve been
using just needs a little tweak? Just that tiny change to make it perfect for
your home?</p>
<p>Well, now you can! 🎉</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/blueprint-automation-take-control.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing a blueprint-based automation that can be taken of using the "Take control" option in the three-dotted menu.'>
<p>You can now <a href="/docs/automation/using_blueprints/#editing-an-imported-blueprint">take full control over the automations created from a blueprint</a>.
By taking control <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:file-edit' title='File edit'></iconify-icon>,
Home Assistant will convert the blueprint automation into a regular,
stand-alone, automation. This allows you to make any tweak you want,
without having to re-invent the wheel.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/blueprint-automation-preview.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing a preview of how a converted blueprint automation would look like before you take control.'>
<p>The cool thing is that it shows you a preview of how the converted automation
would look like before you take over. This way, you can see what you are getting
into before you actually do it.</p>

<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are no longer available as
of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aladdin Connect</strong> has been removed, as Home Assistant cannot use the
upstream library at this time.</li>
<li><strong>Unify Circuit</strong> was deprecated in Home Assistant 2024.5 and has now been
removed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ESPHome update entities for ready-made projects</h2>
<p>Our sister project, <a href="https://esphome.io/projects/">ESPHome</a> received a brand new logo this month! 🎉</p>
<img style='border: 0;box-shadow: none; padding-bottom: 16px' src='https://esphome.io/_static/logo-text-on-light.svg' alt='Logo of ESPHome'>
<p>Looks familiar, right? 😃 That is because ESPHome has <a href="https://esphome.io/changelog/2024.6.0.html#esphome-branding">been donated</a> to the
<a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/blog/announcing-the-open-home-foundation/">Open Home Foundation</a> by <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com">Nabu Casa</a>. The same foundation that the Home
Assistant project is part of.</p>
<p>Besides the new logo, ESPHome has added a new feature that works with this
release of Home Assistant: The ability for makers of
<a href="https://esphome.io/projects/">ready-made devices or projects</a> running on ESPHome, to <a href="https://esphome.io/changelog/2024.6.0.html#update-entities">provide updates</a>
for their devices directly to Home Assistant.</p>
<p>This means that if you have a device that is powered-by or <a href="https://esphome.io/guides/made_for_esphome">Made for ESPHome</a>,
and the maker of that device provides updates for it, you can now update that
device directly from Home Assistant; without the need for you to build, adopt,
or set up the ESPHome software yourself! 😎</p>
<p>These two new features—updating from Home Assistant, and the ESPHome
integration reaching the platinum quality level 🏆—make it easier for new
users and creators to use this powerful platform to build a more Open Home.</p>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is now actually possible to change the username of your Home Assistant
account, thanks <a href="https://github.com/edenhaus">@edenhaus</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/bramkragten">@bramkragten</a>!</li>
<li>Home Assistant will now raise a repair issue if an automation can’t be set up
(for example, because of YAML syntax errors). Thanks <a href="https://github.com/emontnemery">@emontnemery</a>!</li>
<li>We now show additional entity categories on the device page, grouping
<a href="/integrations/notify">notification</a> entities in a “Notification” category. Furthermore, all
<a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a>-related entities, like <a href="/integrations/#voice">conversation agents and text-to-speech</a>
entities, are now grouped in an “Assist” category. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a>!</li>
<li><a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a> now has <em>“Previous”</em> media player intent, adding to the list
of new intents we <a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#improved-media-player-commands">added last release</a>. Nice <a href="https://github.com/OzGav">@OzGav</a>!</li>
<li><a href="/integrations/trend">Trend helpers</a> are now automatically linked to the same device as the source
entity they are based on. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/dougiteixeira">@dougiteixeira</a>!</li>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/generic_thermostat">generic thermostat</a> and <a href="/integrations/generic_hygrostat">generic hygrostat</a> are now available via the
UI, allowing you to create a thermostat or hygrostat based on existing
switches and sensors. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/elupus">@elupus</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Link your template entity to an existing device</h3>
<p><a href="/integrations/template">Template entities</a> are an advanced and powerful way to create your own
<span class='terminology'>entities<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant. Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other entities. An entity is usually part of a device or a service.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/entities_domains/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> in Home Assistant based on any calculation or logic you
can imagine.</p>
<p>One of the <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/why-cant-we-add-template-entities-to-existing-devices/467149">most requested features</a> for <span class='terminology'>template<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A template is an automation definition that can include variables for the action or data from the trigger values. This allows automations to generate dynamic actions.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/templating/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> entities is the
ability to assign and link them to an existing <span class='terminology'>device<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A device is a model representing a physical or logical unit that contains entities.</span></span>. Thanks
to <a href="https://github.com/dougiteixeira">@dougiteixeira</a>, you can now do just that! 🎉</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/templates-link-to-device.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing you can select a device the template can be linked to, when adding a new template helper.'>
<p>Assigning a template entity to an existing device can be very useful if you have
a template that calculates an additional sensor value for a device. For example,
in the screenshot above, a template helper calculates the sum of two sensors
and is linked to the device that has those sensors.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>
  <p class="alert-content">
<p>This feature is only available for template entities that are created
from the UI.</p>
  </p>
</div>
<h3>Change the radius of your home zone</h3>
<p><span class='terminology'>Zones<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Zones allow you to specify certain regions on a map. They enable zone presence-detection and can be used in automations. For example, to start the vacuum after you left home or start the heating at home when you leave the office.<a class='terminology-link' href='/integrations/zone/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> in Home Assistant are a great way to define locations on your
map, such as your work, and trigger automations based on your location. The most
powerful zone is undoubtedly the home zone, which you can use to determine
if someone is home, coming home, or leaving.</p>
<p>Until now, the radius of the home zone was fixed at 100 meters, which was not
always ideal for everyone. Although it could be changed using YAML, as of this
release, you can now change the radius of your home zone directly from the
Home Assistant user interface!</p>
<p><img class="no-shadow" src='/images/docs/configuration/change_location_radius.webp' alt='Screenrecording of how you can now change the radius of the home zone.'><br/></p>
<div class="alert alert-important">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:message-alert-outline'></iconify-icon> Important</p>
  <p class="alert-content">
<p>If you have currently configured and overridden your home zone using YAML

<p>Based on the boiler display code or fault code, the boiler status
has been refactored to be signified and unique so we can start supporting
localization.</p>
<p>Depending on the old status texts, automations or scripts might break.

status values.</p>
