<p>Tesla has brought some much needed, and long awaited, <a href="http://driveteslacanada.ca/supercharger">Supercharger</a> capacity to North Vancouver, British Columbia, opening a brand new 20-stall station at 801 Marine Drive.</p>



<p>Tesla first started construction of the North Vancouver Supercharger <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-starts-construction-on-new-supercharger-in-north-vancouver-british-columbia/">nearly a full year ago in January 2024</a>. The 20-stall station did encounter some construction issues, but these were quickly resolved and the site was ready to be powered up a few months later.</p>



<p>After a long wait, Tesla finally turned on the North Vancouver Supercharger on New Year&#8217;s Eve, <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-gives-update-on-delayed-superchargers-in-canada-7-sites-opening-this-month/">fulfilling their target of before the end of the year</a>. The cost to plug in at the new Supercharger is $0.35/kWh for Tesla vehicles, and $0.47/kWh for non-Tesla electric vehicles.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">New Tesla Supercharger: North Vancouver, BC &#8211; Marine Drive (20 stalls) <a href="https://t.co/EvH2w44x99">https://t.co/EvH2w44x99</a> <a href="https://t.co/VUpF4NeN2N">pic.twitter.com/VUpF4NeN2N</a></p>
— Tesla Charging (@TeslaCharging) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeslaCharging/status/1874179861755158873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2024</a></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>



<p>As you can see from the screenshot above, these 20 stalls have added extra capacity, and will help alleviate the frequent wait times at the other North Vancouver Supercharger at 2032 Lonsdale Avenue. That station was <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/north-vancouver-tesla-supercharger-now-open-british-columbia/">originally built with just 8 stalls</a>, but with a growing number of Tesla owners in the area, Tesla quickly <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/supercharger/north-vancouver-supercharger-expansion-underway-scheduled-to-open-next-week/">expanded the station to 12 stalls just six months after opening</a>.</p>



<p>There are currently five other Supercharger projects in various stages of completion across Vancouver&#8217;s lower mainland. Stations in <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-superchargers-in-langley-and-abbotsford-under-construction-british-columbia/">Abbotsford </a>and <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-supercharger-under-construction-in-delta-british-columbia/">Delta </a>are complete and waiting to be activated, while another two stations are currently under construction in <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/supercharger/new-60-stall-tesla-supercharger-and-destination-charger-station-under-construction-in-east-vancouver-british-columbia/">Vancouver</a>, and another in <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-supercharger-under-construction-in-burnaby-british-columbia/">Burnaby</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/tesla">Tesla </a>has once again shattered records in 2024, deploying an unprecedented 31.4 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of energy storage, highlighting Tesla&#8217;s dominance in the energy storage sector and the accelerating demand for large-scale battery solutions.</p>



<p>The 2024 figures represent a dramatic leap from the previous year. In 2023, Tesla deployed 14.7 GWh of energy storage, which was already a record at the time &#8211; more than double that of 2022. </p>



<p>Breaking down the growth further, Tesla&#8217;s quarterly performance in 2024 consistently outpaced prior records. The second quarter alone <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/energy/teslas-energy-storage-deployments-grow-360-thanks-to-lathrop-megafactory/">saw deployments exceeding 9 GWh</a>, surpassing the total for all of 2021.</p>



<p>To put this in perspective, Tesla&#8217;s energy storage deployments in 2020 amounted to just 3.0 GWh. Over the past four years, the company has achieved a tenfold increase in storage capacity. </p>

<p>Tesla&#8217;s Megapack, a large-scale battery product designed for utility projects, has been the driving force behind this expansion. The Megapack&#8217;s popularity has surged, with major projects being deployed across the US, Europe, and Asia. There have been several notable installations in 2024, including a <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/neoen-powers-up-collie-stage-1-western-australias-largest-battery-powered-by-tesla-megapacks/">219 MW/877 MWh energy storage project</a> in Western Australia and a <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/stanwell-starts-construction-on-300mw-1200mwh-bess-powered-by-tesla-megapack-batteries/">300MW/1200MWh Megapack project</a> in Queensland, Australia.</p>



<p>The energy storage market is expected to continue its rapid growth in 2025. Tesla will be able to meet this growing demand thanks to the scaling of Tesla&#8217;s Megapack production at its <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-celebrates-10000th-megapack-produced-at-lathrop-megafactory/">Megafactory in Lathrop</a>, California, and its<a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-shanghai-megafactory-completes-construction-begins-trial-production-in-record-time/"> newly completed Shanghai Megafactory</a>, both of which are capable of producing 40 MWh annually at full production.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lucid-begins-gravity-suv-deliveries/">Lucid</a> Motors has announced its latest feature, the Lucid Assistant. The <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lucid-gravity-production-kicks-off/">Lucid</a> Assistant is a hands-free voice assistant powered by SoundHound Chat AI. The feature will enhance the Lucid driver&#8217;s experience with interactive knowledge discovery, real-time data, and in-vehicle controls.</p>
<p>In addition to the ability to answer standard AI questions like things to do with the weather, stocks, or sports scores, the Lucid Assistant can answer almost any question about the vehicle&#8217;s functionality.  Also, drivers can use the Assistant to control critical features such as navigation without a cellular connection.</p>
<p>Lucid&#8217;s Head of Software Engineering, Dr. Jean-Phillipe Gauthier, had this to say about the new feature:</p>
<blockquote><p>Developing <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lucid-posts-q3-2024-revenue-beat-reiterates-production-guidance/">Lucid</a> Assistant in cooperation with SoundHound enables us to deliver much more than a voice control feature. In combination with Lucid&#8217;s frequent over-the-air software updates, Lucid Assistant can grow in functionality and capability over time, delivering an ever-better experience for Lucid owners.</p></blockquote>
<p>The feature is now live and available to all Lucid Air owners, and the Assistant will wake up by saying, &#8220;Hey Lucid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lucid Assistant is available in English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, and German, with additional languages being released soon.</p>
<p>If you happen to be attending the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Lucid will show off the Lucid Assistant in a <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lucid-recalls-over-1500-air-pure-rwd-sedans-over-power-loss-risk/">Lucid</a> Air with a hands-on experience at its booth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="http://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/tesla">Tesla</a> capped off 2024 with record-breaking deliveries and energy storage deployments in the fourth quarter, but the automaker couldn’t stave off its first, albeit small, annual sales decline in over a decade.</p>



<p>In the final quarter of 2024, Tesla produced 459,445 vehicles and delivered over 495,570 vehicles globally. This is the highest quarterly delivery figure in the company&#8217;s history, but was short of Wall Street analysts, <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-aims-for-record-q4-2024-deliveries-with-analysts-forecasting-506k-vehicles/">which were expecting over 506,000 deliveries</a>.</p>



<p>For the full year, Tesla delivered 1,789,226 vehicles, narrowly missing the <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-delivers-record-setting-performance-in-2023-production-and-deliveries-top-1-8-million/">1.8 million mark set in 2023</a>, reflecting a slight 1% decline. Despite this, Tesla produced 1,773,443 vehicles at its Gigafactories around the world.</p>



<h3 id="h-breaking-down-the-numbers">Breaking Down the Numbers</h3>



<p>Tesla’s Q4 breakdown shows a continued strong performance in the Model 3/Y segment, which saw 436,718 vehicles produced, and 471,930 units delivered. Other models, which includes the Model S/X and Cybertruck, contributed 22,727 units to the production total and 23,640 to the delivery total. </p>

<p>Energy storage deployments surged to 11.0 GWh in Q4, pushing the total for 2024 to a record 31.4 GWh.</p>



<p>Tesla’s slower growth aligns with CEO Elon Musk’s warnings earlier in the year. On Tesla’s Q1 earnings call, Musk tempered expectations, <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-production-and-deliveries-drop-in-q1-2024/">forecasting a slowdown in growth</a> compared to the 38% surge seen in 2023. Despite price cuts and incentives, including free Supercharging and Full Self-Driving (FSD), sales were unable to maintain the same momentum as previous years.</p>



<h3 id="h-looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h3>



<p>Despite the year-over-year decline, Tesla’s long-term prospects remain strong. The company’s expanding energy division and continued growth in storage deployments signal a strategic diversification beyond vehicles. Additionally, Tesla’s global footprint continues to grow, with expanded production capacity expected to drive future gains.</p>



<p>Tesla will be posting its Q4 2024 financial results on January 29, 2025, and will host a live Q&amp;A session at 4:30 p.m. Central Time (5:30 p.m. Eastern Time).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Las Vegas police are investigating an explosion that involved a Tesla <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-cybertruck-now-eligible-for-7500-tax-credit-in-the-us-cybertruck-rwd-coming-soon/">Cybertruck</a> at the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas early Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>At around 08:40, a Tesla <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-offers-free-lifetime-supercharging-on-foundation-series-cybertruck-inventory-in-the-us/">Cybertruck</a> drove up to the glass entrance of the Trump Hotel and parked. A few minutes later, smoke started coming from the vehicle, and the Cybertruck exploded.</p>
<p>The explosion killed the driver of the <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-releases-fsd-v13-2-1-for-cybertruck-and-canada-2024-39-15/">Cybertruck</a> and left seven individuals with minor injuries.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/nicksortor/status/1874553088578896327</p>
<p>Elon Musk took to X to ensure that people knew the explosion was unrelated to the vehicle. He confirmed that the explosion was caused by fireworks or a bomb carried in the truck bed.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. </p>
<p>All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion. <a href="https://t.co/HRjb87YbaJ">https://t.co/HRjb87YbaJ</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Per Musk, the <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-cybertruck-gets-supercharger-boost-to-325kw-500kw-coming-soon/">Cybertruck</a> was rented on Turo, and he hinted that the attack could be linked to the New Orleans attack that happened on Wednesday as well. The terrorist attack in New Orleans used an F-150 that was rented on the app. No other links have been made.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Appears likely to be an act of terrorism. </p>
<p>Both this Cybertruck and the F-150 suicide bomb in New Orleans were rented from Turo. Perhaps they are linked in some way. <a href="https://t.co/MM6ehJO3SG">https://t.co/MM6ehJO3SG</a></p>

<p>A Las Vegas Police Department spokesperson noted that there is no longer a threat to the Las Vegas community but did advise citizens to avoid the area and that hotel guests have been moved to a different location. The police department has not linked the two attacks, nor have they released the cause of the explosion.</p>

<p>Tesla has rolled back its <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/dan72985">referral benefits</a> to standard levels for 2025 following an aggressive year-end push in 2024. </p>



<p>As of January 1, 2025, Canadian buyers can now receive C$1,300 off their purchase of a Model S, Model X, or Model Y when using a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/dan72985">referral link</a>. Unfortunately, the Model 3 remains ineligible for referral program in Canada. Meanwhile US buyers can get a US$1,000 discount on the Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, or Cybertruck.</p>



<p>For existing Tesla owners, the rewards for successful <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/dan72985">referrals </a>have also been adjusted. Canadian owners now earn C$650 per referral, while US owners receive US$500. These credits can then be used to purchase things like accessories and software upgrades, pay for service visits, or even be applied toward the purchase of a new Tesla.</p>

<p>Another important change for the start of the year is your referral counter has been reset, and you can now earn up to an additional 10 referrals in 2025. Keep in mind that any previous referrals from 2024 will expire 12 months from the date they were earned. For example, if you earned a referral on November 1, 2024, it will expire on November 1, 2025.</p>



<p>These discounts and rewards represent a return to Tesla’s typical referral structure after the company <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-doubles-referral-discounts-and-rewards/">temporarily doubled the incentives</a> to boost sales at the end of 2024. During that period, buyers were able to save up to C$2,600 in Canada and up to US$2,000 in the US by using a referral link, while owners could earn up to C$1,300 or US$1,000.</p>

<p>Tesla <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-offers-free-lifetime-supercharging-on-foundation-series-cybertruck-inventory-in-the-us/">Cybertruck </a>buyers in the US have received a New Year&#8217;s Day gift as the electric pickup truck is now eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit in the US. Along with the new eligiblity, the federal government has also indicated a cheaper Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) variant of the Cybertruck may be coming soon.</p>



<p>According to new data published by the Internal Revenue Service (<a href="https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml">IRS</a>) on January 1, the tax credit applies to the Dual Motor version of the Cybertruck, lowering the starting price for qualifying buyers from $79,990 to $72,490. The eligibility stems from Tesla’s ability to keep the MSRP of these configurations under the $80,000 cap required for electric trucks to qualify for the incentive.</p>



<p>While the Dual Motor Cybertruck is already in production and available to consumers, the Single Motor, Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) Cybertruck has yet to be officially announced. Despite this, IRS listing indicates that Tesla plans to introduce this more affordable version in the near future.</p>



<p>The Tri-Motor Cyberbeast, with its price of $99,990, is not eligible for the incentive.</p>



<p>The updated tax credit guidelines are effective for vehicles delivered between January 1, 2025, and before January 1, 2026. </p>

<p>While the federal government has updated their website to indicate the Cybertruck&#8217;s eligiblity for the incentive, Tesla does not yet include the point-of-sale deduction on their online configurator.</p>



<p>However, uncertainty lingers over the future of the tax credit program. Political factors could influence its longevity, with potential changes to EV incentives under the incoming administration. <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/trump-plans-to-end-the-ev-tax-credit-could-it-benefit-tesla/">President-elect Donald Trump has already indicated he will eliminate EV tax credits</a>, a stance supported by Elon Musk. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk has taken some time away from guiding incoming US President Donald Trump to meet with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa over <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/kyivstar-and-starlink-partner-to-launch-direct-to-cell-satellite-service-in-ukraine/">Starlink</a> and Tesla.</p>
<p>According to<em> Bloomberg</em>, Musk and Ramaphosa discussed a host of issues, including easing regulations in South Africa to allow <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/alaskan-ferry-installs-starlink-in-6-25-million-wi-fi-roll-out/">Starlink</a> to operate legally. The specific regulation in question requires Starlink to be at least 30% black-owned and share equity with local partners.</p>
<p>South African officials confirmed the discussions and noted that they are considering local investment and jobs in lieu of the ownership regulations. Specifically, the officials noted that they were interested in Tesla investing in a battery production plant in the country.</p>
<p>This is not the first time a country has tried to tie in Starlink access and Tesla investment. Indonesia allowed <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/politician-pushes-for-starlink-as-the-future-of-rural-connectivity-in-british-columbia/">Starlink</a> access to rural parts of Bali, but a long-held priority by the Indonesian government was for Tesla to open a battery plant there. Per the <em>Wall Street Journal,</em> Tesla was initially interested, but due to the location, Tesla rebuffed. Interestingly, Indonesia is still working on Musk and recently proposed building data centres for <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/elon-musk-denies-tesla-xai-revenue-share-agreement/">xAI.</a></p>
<p>Neither South African officials nor SpaceX has confirmed what was discussed at the meeting between Musk and Ramaphosa. Tesla representatives also did not comment on the <em>Bloomberg</em> report.</p>

<p>Lucid has officially started delivering its <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lucid-gravity-production-kicks-off/">Gravity </a>SUV. The first units of the Gravity, Lucid’s second production model, were handed over to employees, friends, and families, this past weekend, ahead of customer deliveries in 2025.</p>



<p>This milestone follows months of production preparation at Lucid’s Casa Grande, Arizona factory. <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lucid-unveils-gravity-suv-with-nacs-charge-port-and-teases-midsize-crossover/">Pre-production of the Gravity</a> began in July 2024, with CEO Peter Rawlinson personally driving the first unit off the line. Now, just before the end of the year, Lucid is moving forward with the first deliveries to employees and friends and family, before the broader customer rollout.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This weekend the first Lucid Gravity customers received their vehicles and departed the factory as a convoy.<br><br>This is just the beginning. Here&#39;s to a remarkable 2025. <a href="https://t.co/ZIF5MwhNnX">pic.twitter.com/ZIF5MwhNnX</a></p>&mdash; Lucid Motors (@LucidMotors) <a href="https://twitter.com/LucidMotors/status/1873858864787185839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>The Lucid Gravity enters the market as a premium full-size SUV with an EPA-estimated range of up to 724km (450 miles). Its launch pricing starts at US$94,900 for the Grand Touring trim, <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lucid-gravity-orders-open-in-the-us-tops-out-at-126-5k/">extending up to US$126,500 with options</a>. </p>



<p>Lucid’s long-term plan includes offering a more affordable Gravity Touring model, expected to start at under US$80,000 by late 2025. </p>



<p>A key highlight of the Gravity is its integrated Tesla NACS (North American Charging Standard) port, making it the second non-Tesla EV to offer direct Supercharger access, <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/hyundai-unlocks-20000-tesla-superchargers-in-2025-with-free-nacs-adapters/">following Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 from earlier this month</a>. </p>



<p>Lucid’s approach to the Gravity’s release reflects a careful strategy. By beginning deliveries with internal circles, the company can gather feedback and address potential issues before expanding to general customers. This method mirrors Lucid’s launch of the Air sedan, which followed a similar staged delivery process.</p>



<p>Customer deliveries in the US are slated to begin in early 2025, with Canadian deliveries to follow shortly thereafter, and European deliveries expected by 2026. </p>

<p>Tesla has reached another impressive milestone with the completion of its Shanghai <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-shanghai-megafactory-nears-completion/">Megafactory</a>, marking the company&#8217;s first energy storage production facility outside the United States. </p>



<p>This new facility, located near Tesla’s existing vehicle Gigafactory in the Lingang area, is dedicated to manufacturing Megapack energy storage batteries and has already started trial production after successfully passing a compleition inspection on December 27, just seven months after <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-building-shanghai-megafactory-for-megapack-batteries/">construction began in May 2024</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-record-setting-construction-timeline">A Record-Setting Construction Timeline</h3>



<p>The Shanghai Megafactory exemplifies the company&#8217;s renowned “Tesla speed,” completing construction in record time. This rapid development mirrors that of Tesla’s first Shanghai Gigafactory, which was built within a year in 2019. The new facility spans an impressive 2,100,000 square feet and represents a significant investment of approximately 1.45 billion yuan (C$286M/US$202M).</p>



<h3 id="h-capacity-and-global-impact">Capacity and Global Impact</h3>



<p>The Shanghai Megafactory is designed to produce 10,000 Megapacks annually, equivalent to approximately 40 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of energy storage, matching the output of Tesla&#8217;s other Megafactory in Lathrop, Califronia. </p>



<p>Each Megapack can store more than 3 megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy, enough to power around 3,600 homes for an hour. The facility will primarily serve the domestic market but also contribute significantly to Tesla&#8217;s global energy storage supply chain.</p>



<p>Energy storage has become a crucial growth driver for Tesla. The company’s energy generation and storage revenue surged by 52% year-over-year in Q3 2024, reaching $2.38 billion with a record gross margin of 30.5%. The Shanghai Megafactory is poised to further bolster these numbers, positioning Tesla as a leader in the commercial energy storage market.</p>



<h3 id="h-first-customer-and-partners">First Customer and Partners</h3>



<p>The groundbreaking of the Megafactory included a contract signing with the Shanghai Lingang Economic Development Group, securing the facility&#8217;s first orders for Megapacks in China. Furthermore, Tesla has expanded its supply chain partnerships, with CATL and BYD&#8217;s FinDreams set to provide lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells for the Megapacks starting in Q1 2025. </p>



<p>As Tesla gears up for mass production in Q1 2025, the Shanghai Megafactory represents a significant step forward in meeting the growing demand for renewable energy solutions worldwide. </p>
