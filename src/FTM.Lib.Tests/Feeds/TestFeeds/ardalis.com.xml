The two terms often come up in conversations about architecture, design patterns, and coding best practices, but what do they really mean? In this post, we&apos;ll break down the difference and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;YouTube&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cg4w-MgjkLA?si=LcOwZQKK3c4Q_y7U&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is an Interface?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interface in software development defines &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; a component or class can do. Think of it like a contract or a blueprint. It specifies the methods or behaviors that must be available without dictating &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they should be carried out. (While &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/advanced-topics/interface-implementation/default-interface-methods-versions&quot;&gt;default interface methods&lt;/a&gt; are a special case in modern languages like C#, they don&apos;t change the fundamental role of interfaces as abstractions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine you&apos;re creating an interface for a file reader. The interface might define methods like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Open()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Read()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Close()&lt;/code&gt;. However, it doesn&apos;t specify whether the file is read from a local drive, from the cloud, or even from a database. It simply outlines &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; the class should be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, the interface focuses on the &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt;—the behavior and capabilities your system should expose. This allows different parts of a system to interact without needing to know the internal workings of the other parts. It&apos;s a definite &lt;a href=&quot;https://deviq.com/antipatterns/code-smells&quot;&gt;code smell&lt;/a&gt; if your interface indicates &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; it accomplishes the operations it exposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interfaces describe what; Implementations describe how.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is an Implementation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation, on the other hand, defines &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; those methods or behaviors are actually carried out. Continuing with the file reader example, the implementation would contain the logic to open, read, and close files in a specific environment, such as reading a local file or making HTTP requests to download a file from the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the interface lays out &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; needs to be done, the implementation handles the nitty-gritty details of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it&apos;s done. This separation is essential because it allows for flexibility and scalability. For example, you could have multiple implementations of the same interface: one for local files, another for cloud storage, and yet another for database access, all without changing how the rest of your system interacts with those components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the interface&apos;s job is to simply describe &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; needs to happen. The implementation is responsible for &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; it&apos;s done, in some specific manner. (and if you&apos;re wondering about &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://ardalis.com/getting-started-with-architecture-decision-records/&quot;&gt;architecture decision records&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why the Separation Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By separating the &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;, you gain tremendous flexibility. Changing how something is done (such as switching from reading a local file to reading from a cloud storage service) doesn&apos;t require changes to every part of the code that interacts with the file reader. Instead, you simply swap out one implementation for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the calling code&apos;s perspective, it shouldn&apos;t be concerned about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the task is performed, as long as it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; performed. When you&apos;re able to achieve this kind of separation, it makes your software design much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This separation also makes your code much easier to test. You can mock or stub out the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; part (the implementation) when writing unit tests and focus solely on whether the system behaves as expected based on the interface. Maybe in production the file access implementation works with real files. However, in your tests you need to change how it works. The test implementation may simply return an expected string or result, or maybe it throws an exception saying the file doesn&apos;t exist. It&apos;s often much easier to set up and run tests using mock or fake implementations of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; than by using the production &quot;real&quot; version of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the code implements the interface in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Maintainability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, maintaining code becomes easier when the &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; are decoupled. Consumers of the interface need only worry about the interface, not the underlying details, making such code simpler and more loosely coupled. Implementations, too, become simpler since they too can focus solely on implementing the (hopefully &lt;a href=&quot;https://deviq.com/principles/interface-segregation&quot;&gt;small and cohesive&lt;/a&gt;) interface, without regard for every possible way the whole system might need to perform related tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real-World Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s consider another common real-world example: sending notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interface&lt;/strong&gt;: You might define an interface called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ISendEmail&lt;/code&gt; with a single method: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Send()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;: One implementation might send emails using an SMTP server, while another might send emails using a cloud service provider. Yet another might simply send a message on a message queue for some other part of the system to deal with. The rest of the system doesn&apos;t care how notifications are sent; it only interacts with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ISendEmail&lt;/code&gt; interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If later on you need to switch from SMTP to a cloud provider or your own microservice, you need only switch out implementations. The &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; described by the interface remains unchanged, and so too does all of your code that consumes that interface. Only the implementations, which describe &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; the sending is done, need to be changed. Ideally, instead of modifying existing implementations, you introduce new ones as needed, ensuring minimal disruption to the system. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weeklydevtips.com/episodes/015&quot;&gt;Learn more.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the difference between interfaces (what) and implementations (how) is a foundational concept in software design that improves flexibility, testability, and maintainability. It allows you to build systems where the underlying functionality can evolve without breaking the contracts that the rest of your application depends on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By focusing on the &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; with interfaces, and leaving the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to implementations, you can create modular, scalable, and adaptable codebases that are easier to manage over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[You Should Blog]]></title><description><![CDATA[As a software developer, you might spend most of your time immersed in code, solving problems, and building innovative solutions.

But have you ever considered starting a blog? If you haven&apos;t, let me give you some compelling reasons why you should. This is advice I frequently give to members of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://devBetter.com&quot;&gt;developer group coaching program at devBetter.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watch the Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yRLaoq_q1a8?si=AhncsYcrusSLaOat&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Sharpen Your Skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to deepen your understanding of any topic is to teach it to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To teach is to learn twice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you blog, you have to explain concepts clearly and coherently, which forces you to truly grasp the material. Whether you&apos;re writing about complex algorithms, new technologies, or simple tips and tricks, blogging solidifies your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you sit down to write, it&apos;s like attending a mini bootcamp. You&apos;re researching, organizing your thoughts, and sometimes even learning new things in the process. Over time, this consistent practice can significantly sharpen your skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If writing doesn&apos;t come easily to you, well, that&apos;s another reason to start a blog! &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeklydevtips.com/episodes/040&quot;&gt;If it hurts, do it more often&lt;/a&gt;. The more often you do it, the better and more efficient you&apos;ll become!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Build Your Personal Brand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&apos;s digital age, your online presence is more important than ever. A blog is a fantastic way to showcase your expertise, interests, and &lt;em&gt;unique voice&lt;/em&gt;. Imagine someone Googles your name and finds a collection of high-quality, insightful content that you&apos;ve created. That&apos;s a powerful personal brand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-maintained blog can open doors to job opportunities, speaking engagements, and collaborations that you might not have anticipated. It positions you as an authority in your field and sets you apart from others in the industry. It&apos;s also an excellent way to establish &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt;. Having an online presence where you share information about yourself and your expertise in a curated and professional manner is a great way to develop an audience who, over time, will begin to feel like &lt;em&gt;they know you&lt;/em&gt; - even though you&apos;ve never met! Think about some of the folks in our industry you&apos;ve heard, seen, or read and you&apos;ll know what I mean. Videos and podcasts can provide an even closer connection. However, publishing text is often a much easier entry point for developers than jumping into podcasting or YouTube/TikTok...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you care about your personal brand? Maybe you&apos;re not a consultant or independent developer, but rather you just work at a regular job for some company. That&apos;s fine, but perhaps you&apos;ve noticed that many of those regular jobs keep encountering sweeping and often completely unexpected layoffs in the last few years. If, and hopefully not, but if you were to be impacted by such an event, would you rather be trying to find a new position as a relatively unknown entity (along side everyone else applying for similar positions)? Or would you rather write a blog post announcing your newfound availability and, with a large enough audience, have some confidence that someone would &lt;strong&gt;reach out to you&lt;/strong&gt; with an opportunity to talk about a role in their organization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Document Your Learning Journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is also an excellent way to document your learning journey. We all start somewhere, and having a record of your progress can be incredibly rewarding. Plus, it&apos;s beneficial to others who might be just a few steps behind you in &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; learning journey. In fact, if you&apos;ve ever thought &lt;em&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t have anything to say - someone smarter has already written about it&quot;&lt;/em&gt; remember (if nothing else), your content will be more recent than anyone else&apos;s. It&apos;s going to reflect your personal experience. Your assumptions. The latest version of whatever you&apos;re working with. The steps &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; took to approach and hopefully solve any problems encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, someone else may be the expert, but a lot of the time beginners learn best from a fellow beginner who just went through the process. And guess what? &lt;strong&gt;There are always a lot more beginners than experts&lt;/strong&gt; so writing content focused on beginners is a great way to reach a larger audience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your early posts might serve as inspiration or guidance for those who are new to the field. It&apos;s a great way to show that learning is a continuous process, and everyone develops at their own pace. Nobody knows everything, and nobody expects you to know everything. Write about things that interest you, including things you&apos;re just starting to investigate, and many others who share that interest will tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Contribute to the Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer community thrives on shared knowledge. We&apos;ve all benefited from tutorials, forums, and blog posts that have helped us solve tough problems or learn something new. By starting your own blog, you can contribute back to this collective pool of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your insights and experiences could be exactly what someone else needs to overcome a challenge. It&apos;s a great way to give back to the community that has supported your growth as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Help Out Future You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever solved a tricky problem, only to forget the details when you run into it again months or even years later? Blogging is a great way to document the solutions you&apos;ve discovered, creating a personal knowledge base that you can refer back to whenever you need it. I often search for &quot;some topic ardalis&quot; to find things I&apos;ve written about in the past. If you&apos;re already taking notes somewhere (paper, Notion, OneNote, whatever) think of your blog as another place you can take notes, but with the added benefit of being able to search for them later from anywhere &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; you get all the other benefits in this article! Win-Win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By writing about the problems you encounter and the solutions you devise, you&apos;re not just helping others—you&apos;re helping your future self. Instead of spending time retracing your steps or searching for that obscure fix you found ages ago, you can simply revisit your own blog and get back on track quickly. It&apos;s like creating a manual for your future self, saving you time and frustration down the road. Future You will thank Present You!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Improve Your Communication Skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective communication is a crucial skill in any profession, and blogging is a great way to practice it. Writing forces you to explain technical concepts in a clear, concise, and engaging way. Over time, this practice will enhance your ability to communicate not just in writing, but also in meetings, presentations, and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved communication skills can lead to better job performance, stronger leadership abilities, and more effective teamwork. It&apos;s a(nother) win-win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But But But&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But... I&apos;m already on social media&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media content, generally, isn&apos;t optimized for long term access. A post you write on Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook is unlikely to come up on the first page of Google unless it&apos;s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; popular, even if content is an exact match for the search. Also, there&apos;s nothing to prevent any 3rd party platform from de-listing you, or changing their algorithm to stop featuring you, etc. It&apos;s always better for you to own your own content so this can&apos;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But... I don&apos;t have time&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common concern, especially when you&apos;re juggling a full-time job, personal projects, and maybe even a family. But here&apos;s the thing—blogging doesn&apos;t have to consume your life. Start small - write one post a month, or even just a few times a year. The key is consistency, not frequency. Over time, these small efforts add up and can have a big impact. And remember your blog posts don&apos;t have to be a certain number of words. Sometimes a short post (unlike this one) is all you need!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But... I&apos;m not a good writer&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&apos;t need to be a professional writer to start a blog. Blogging is about sharing your thoughts, experiences, and knowledge, not about crafting perfect prose. In fact, the more authentic and relatable your voice, the better. Your writing will improve with practice, and the important thing is to get started. Plus, the developer community is generally more interested in the value of your content than your writing style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But... I don&apos;t have anything unique to say&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might feel that there&apos;s already so much content out there, and you don&apos;t have anything new to add. But remember, your perspective is unique. The way you explain something might resonate with someone in a way that other content hasn&apos;t. Plus, even if the topic has been covered before, your personal experiences, tips, and insights can provide a fresh take. Don&apos;t underestimate the value of your voice. See point 3 above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need help coming up with ideas for things to write about, I posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://ardalis.com/5-solid-ways-to-come-up-with-good-blog-post-topics/&quot;&gt;5 Solid Ways to Come Up with Good Blog Post Topics&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, and I plan on writing an updated version of this soon (since that one doesn&apos;t cover things like AI and how it can help you with your blogging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But... Nobody will read it&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, your blog might not have a large audience, and that&apos;s okay. It takes time to build a readership. However, even if only a few people read your posts, those people could find your content incredibly valuable. And as your blog grows, so will your audience. Focus on creating content that&apos;s useful, and the readers will come. And remember, you can start out by just writing your blog as notes &lt;strong&gt;just for you&lt;/strong&gt;. That&apos;s what I did, and it just so happened that other folks found some of my articles useful, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But... Blogging is outdated&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might argue that blogging has been replaced by video content or social media, but that&apos;s not true. While these platforms are popular, blogging remains a powerful medium for in-depth content, tutorials, and technical explanations. It&apos;s also highly searchable, which means your content can continue to be discovered long after it&apos;s published. Blogs provide a space for deeper dives into topics that short-form content just can&apos;t cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers, blogs provide a great place to share content that has to do with &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt;. It&apos;s much harder for content consumers to search for or extract code from a video or a podcast. Inlining and explaining code blocks in blogs/text is much easier to consume and understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start Your Blog Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;ve been thinking about starting a blog, there&apos;s no better time than now. Grab a domain, pick a platform, and start writing. The benefits you&apos;ll gain—from sharpening your skills to building your personal brand—make it a worthwhile investment in your career and personal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t let perfect be the enemy of good. If coming up with a domain or figuring out how to blog is slowing you down from writing that first article, just go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to&quot;&gt;DEV.to&lt;/a&gt; and start there. I highly recommend that you own your own content, including your blog, so I wouldn&apos;t &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; at a third-party site. But it&apos;s a good way to get started. Similarly, anyone in my devBetter program can blog on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.devbetter.com/&quot;&gt;blogs.devbetter.com&lt;/a&gt; at least until they have their own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging might seem daunting at first, but remember, everyone starts somewhere. Your future self will thank you for taking the plunge. So go ahead, start your blog today, and watch how it transforms your journey as a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;

How do you keep the gains you (hopefully) made in breaking up your legacy ball of mud, without having to constantly contend with a massively distributed system? Migrate to a modular monolith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microservices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microservices have been all the rage for the past several years. They offer a way to break up large, monolithic applications into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can make it easier to scale, deploy, and maintain your application. However, microservices come with their own set of challenges. They can be difficult to manage, especially as the number of services grows. They can also introduce latency and complexity into your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know who really loves microservices? Cloud hosting companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. They make a lot of money hosting microservices. They also make a lot of money selling you tools to manage your microservices. They make even more money when you have to scale up your microservices to handle the increased load on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who else? Consultants. They love microservices. They can charge you a lot of money to help you break up your monolith into microservices. They can charge you even more money to help you manage your microservices. They can charge you even more money to help you scale your microservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let&apos;s not forget your developers. They love microservices. They get to work on lots of different services. They get to learn lots of different technologies. Most importantly, they get to practice Resume-Driven Development, as they happily add microservices experience to their CVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/dinosaur-howareyouwithmicroservices.png&quot; alt=&quot;how are you with microservices?&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modular Monoliths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do when you find yourself in microservice hell? How do you keep the gains you (hopefully) made in breaking up your legacy ball of mud, without having to constantly contend with a massively distributed system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be time to (re)consider the modular monolith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A modular monolith is a monolithic application that is broken up into modules. Each module is responsible for a specific part of the application. Modules can communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces. This allows you to keep the benefits of a monolithic architecture, while still being able to break up your application into smaller, more manageable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/modular-monoliths-vs-microservices-graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;modularity vs number of deployed applications&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you&apos;ll still need to deal with some complexity inherent to modularity, such as ensuring modules remain independent while still being able to communicate with one another efficiently. But you&apos;ll avoid having to deal with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing&quot;&gt;fallacies of distributed computing&lt;/a&gt;, such as network latency, bandwidth, and failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Microservices to Modular Monoliths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating from microservices to a modular monolith is not a trivial task. It will require careful planning and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve authored a short course on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dometrain.com/author/steve-ardalis-smith/&quot;&gt;Dometrain&lt;/a&gt; (where I also have two courses on building modular monoliths in .NET) that covers this topic in more detail.

Recently, I received an interesting question from one of the students of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dometrain.com/bundle/from-zero-to-hero-modular-monoliths-in-dotnet/&quot;&gt;my modular monoliths course&lt;/a&gt;, which I thought others might appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Student Query&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modular Monolith course question (EFCore Navigation Properties)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message:
&lt;em&gt;Hi Steve,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just got done with your modular monoliths course and loved it. I have a question about how navigation properties work inside each module using EFCore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let&apos;s say I have an entity called Booking, that has a foreign key to a CustomerId, how would I map that using EFCore&apos;s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;EntityTypeBuilder&lt;/code&gt;? I could usually do:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;builder&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token generic-method&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;HasOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token generic class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Customer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;WithMany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;HasForeignKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;booking &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; booking&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;CustomerId&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;IsRequired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However this doesn&apos;t work, as the Customer entity is in another module so I cannot reference it as the navigation property?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just wondering if you had the answer to this, as i&apos;m struggling to understand it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Response&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;em&gt;NAME&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it&apos;s a common question, so don&apos;t feel bad about having it. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to look at it but the key is to reframe how you think about related data that belongs to a different module. It&apos;s natural to think about that data as being all part of &quot;your&quot; application and its data store, and as such to use conveniences like navigation properties and, at the database level, tools like foreign keys to ensure referential integrity. While sometimes you can get away with this (if you opt to use a single database for all of your modules, for instance), it&apos;s a tradeoff and always sacrifices independence for that convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine instead that the data owned by other modules is outside not just that module but outside your organization. You&apos;re trying to link to a Customer in this example, via a CustomerId. Well, pretend that the Customer record actually lives in a Salesforce.com CRM (or some other external CRM) and all you have is its key/ID. Sure, if you need info on that customer, you can always make an API call to Salesforce to fetch their data. But you&apos;re not going to perform a database join on it, because you don&apos;t own that data locally. Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the short answer is, &lt;em&gt;don&apos;t use navigation properties for entities that live outside your module&lt;/em&gt;. Instead always just use keys, and then use a strategy to get the data like you saw me do in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dometrain.com/bundle/from-zero-to-hero-modular-monoliths-in-dotnet/&quot;&gt;the course&lt;/a&gt;. You can use MediatR queries to make in-process calls to fetch data as-needed between modules. And if you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to have the data locally in your database, you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/materialized-view&quot;&gt;Materialized View pattern&lt;/a&gt; that I demonstrated to keep a local copy of another module&apos;s data in your database (and keep it synchronized using events or another strategy). At that point you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have navigation properties and perform joins on that data, but you should take care not to modify any of the data in the MV because it&apos;s essentially a read-only cache. If you need to make changes, send a command to the module that owns that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that helps,
Steve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Student Response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Steve,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for getting back to me so quickly and really appreciate the thorough response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That totally makes sense to me now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what helped me grasp it was changing my mindset on where the other modules could potentially be stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes complete sense to not have any hard dependencies on other modules (basically modular monolith 101).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much appreciated and look forward to any future content you put out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you&apos;re segmenting your application into discrete parts, whether these are &lt;a href=&quot;https://deviq.com/domain-driven-design/aggregate-pattern&quot;&gt;DDD Aggregates&lt;/a&gt; or Modules in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dometrain.com/bundle/from-zero-to-hero-modular-monoliths-in-dotnet/&quot;&gt;Modular Monolith&lt;/a&gt;, you&apos;re going to want to isolate data dependencies between the parts. One way this manifests is in your design of your domain entities. With Aggregates, a general good practice to follow is to only have navigation properties flowing in &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; one direction from the root to its children (and if necessary, their children). If you follow this advice, your modules will automatically be fine, since there will never be a child of an aggregate defined in a separate module from the aggregate&apos;s root. But in any case, data that is outside of an aggregate or module should only be referenced using its key or ID, not as a navigation property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that if, for performance or other reasons, you need to have local access to related data that is owned by another module or system, you can use the Materialized View pattern to keep a local read-only cache of the data you need. And then when it makes sense you can join on this data or include it in EF queries using navigation properties.&lt;/p&gt;

Although definitions and especially hard measurements of what maintainable means with regard to software may vary, it can be useful to compare maintainable code to the much more easily verified unit testability of that code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing software quality, two important concepts often arise: unit testable code and maintainable code. While these concepts are distinct, they share many characteristics. This article explores the overlap between unit testable code and maintainable code in C#, highlighting how striving for one often leads to achieving the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/unit-testable-maintainable-code.png&quot; alt=&quot;venn diagram of unit testable code and maintainable code&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Characteristics of Unit Testable Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit testable code is designed to be easily and effectively tested in isolation. Key characteristics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loose Coupling&lt;/strong&gt;: Dependencies are minimized and managed through interfaces or dependency injection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;: Each class or method has a single responsibility, making it easier to test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal External Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;: Code avoids direct dependencies on external systems (e.g., databases, file systems) during tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deterministic Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;: Code produces consistent results, which is crucial for repeatable tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testable Design Patterns&lt;/strong&gt;: Use of design patterns like Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) to facilitate testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast&lt;/strong&gt;: Unit tests are incredibly fast to run and typically should be capable of being run in parallel to optimize for speed of execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Characteristics of Maintainable Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintainable code is designed to be easily understood, modified, and extended. Key characteristics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readability&lt;/strong&gt;: Code is easy to read and understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modularity&lt;/strong&gt;: Code is divided into distinct, loosely-coupled modules, each with a clear purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency&lt;/strong&gt;: Code follows consistent naming conventions and coding standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;: Code is well-documented, making it easier for others to understand its purpose and functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Coverage&lt;/strong&gt;: Code is well-tested, ensuring that changes do not introduce new bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overlap Between Unit Testable Code and Maintainable Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overlap between unit testable code and maintainable code includes the following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loose Coupling and Single Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;: Both characteristics enhance readability, maintainability, and testability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal External Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduces complexity and makes code more robust and easier to test and maintain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deterministic Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensures reliability and predictability, essential for both quality and maintainability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testable Design Patterns&lt;/strong&gt;: Encourage best practices that improve code quality and maintainability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tightly Coupled Code (Difficult to Test and Maintain)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;FileLogger&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token return-type class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; message&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        System&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;IO&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;File&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;WriteAllText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;log.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; message&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;OrderProcessor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;FileLogger&lt;/span&gt; _logger &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constructor-invocation class-name&quot;&gt;FileLogger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token return-type class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ProcessOrder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Order&lt;/span&gt; order&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Logic required to process the order&lt;/span&gt;

        _logger&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Order processed: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; order&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above code example is difficult to unit test because of the direct dependency on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FileLogger&lt;/code&gt; type, resulting in tight coupling (remember, &lt;a href=&quot;/new-is-glue&quot;&gt;New is Glue&lt;/a&gt;). Any attempt to unit test the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ProcessOrder&lt;/code&gt; method (running to its completion, and thus hitting the logger call) will fail if the test cannot access the log.txt file. Tests run in parallel are likely to result in file access errors, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from testing concerns, the above code cannot take advantage of alternative file stores, such as Azure Blob Storage or Amazon S3, not to mention redirecting log output to other locations, as may be desirable in various environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Loosely Coupled Code (Easy to Test and Maintain)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ILogger&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token return-type class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; message&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;FileLogger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token type-list&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ILogger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        _logger&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Order processed: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; order&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the above &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;OrderProcessor&lt;/code&gt; version doesn&apos;t include any instance of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword. Instead if follows the Explicit Dependencies Principle and clearly informs anyone calling or simply reading this class that it requires a logger of type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ILogger&lt;/code&gt;, which is an incredibly simple abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you&apos;ll see below, it&apos;s now trivial to test the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ProcessOrder&lt;/code&gt; method, and also trivial to swap out the file logger implementation with any number of alternative loggers (or even several using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://deviq.com/design-patterns/decorator-pattern&quot;&gt;Decorator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://deviq.com/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility-pattern&quot;&gt;Chain of Responsibility pattern&lt;/a&gt;). The resulting code is much more extensible with zero additional cyclomatic complexity and only one additional interface type.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Assert&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striving for unit testable code often results in maintainable code. By focusing on loose coupling, single responsibility, minimal external dependencies, and deterministic behavior, developers can achieve code that is both easy to test and maintain. Incorporating testable design patterns further ensures code quality, making it more robust and scalable.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, I received an interesting question from one of the students of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dometrain.com/bundle/from-zero-to-hero-modular-monoliths-in-dotnet/&quot;&gt;my modular monoliths course&lt;/a&gt;, which I thought others might appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Student Query&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi Steve, I have another question for you after finishing the deep dive course. Let&apos;s say that now I have multiple modules, each of them with IDs of other entities in their domain. I don&apos;t want to serve data from module A in module B, so I just return the ID to the consumer and let them call module A with it. The problem is that following this pattern, the consumer could be forced to do a lot of calls just to jump between our domains. Could it make sense to implement an API Gateway? How could it be implemented in a modular monolith environment?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Response&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a single client, like a SPA (Angular, React, Blazor), I would typically use the Backend-For-Frontend (BFF) pattern, which can be implemented either as its own separate project or simply configured as an API Gateway (using something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts#api-gateway&quot;&gt;Azure API Gateway&lt;/a&gt; or something as simple as &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/&quot;&gt;YARP&lt;/a&gt;). In microservices architectures, it&apos;s usually a separate standalone instance that has access to the public internet while the rest of the services are behind the firewall. In a modular monolith scenario, it would typically be the same — a separate instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tradeoff you&apos;re making is between modularity/coupling and performance. If you just pass an ID all the way to the client, and then it needs to make a new call to get the details for that record, it&apos;s another round trip compared to if you just gave it the data directly. This is a minor problem if it&apos;s just one thing, but it gets much worse if it&apos;s a collection of things (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping&quot;&gt;classic N+1 problem&lt;/a&gt; but via APIs not database queries).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My usual approach is to not worry about the performance problems prematurely, but once you can see (and ideally measure!) them, take some steps to mitigate them. These steps include some usual suspects and some unique to this problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Indexes&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensure fetching the data is as fast as you can easily make it. Optimized database queries can significantly reduce the latency of data retrieval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Store Optimization&lt;/strong&gt;: Consider having a separate read store that&apos;s optimized for queries. This store can be updated asynchronously from the main data store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server Caching&lt;/strong&gt;: Implement server-side caching. It&apos;s always faster to serve data from memory than to fetch it from a database. Use an in-memory cache or a separate service like Redis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materialized Views&lt;/strong&gt;: Add a materialized view to module A containing module B&apos;s data. When module A returns data referencing module B items, it can (optionally, with an API parameter specifying the extra data should be pulled back) include those items in its payload directly without the need for any server-side communication (and also eliminating the need for any client-side fetches for the module B items).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batch Fetching&lt;/strong&gt;: Add APIs for fetching multiple IDs at a time. For instance, when module A returns 10 records and those 10 records include references to 10 module B IDs, those 10 records can be fetched with one call to module B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By implementing these strategies, you can maintain the modularity of your monolith while also mitigating potential performance issues that arise from cross-module data dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Student Response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steve, you’re simply the best. Thanks for the detailed answer, everything makes sense. Have a wonderful day!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s worth considering how the client of your APIs will consume them, and how it may be necessary for it to make separate calls to fetch the details of any associated IDs you include in your payloads. It&apos;s always a tradeoff in API design between sending too much or too little data, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ardalis.com/data-deficient-messages&quot;&gt;data deficient messages&lt;/a&gt; are a common problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging patterns such as BFF (which lets you customize your APIs and their messages specifically to suit the needs of your client), server caching, and optimized data fetching techniques, you can achieve a balance between modular design and system performance.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the participants was complaining about the mess they were cleaning up from a team they&apos;d joined. The team had, ostensibly, been following &lt;a href=&quot;https://ardalis.com/clean-architecture-asp-net-core/&quot;&gt;Clean Architecture&lt;/a&gt;, but the code they had produced was a mess. Their conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean Architecture sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They led with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean Architecture and its obsession with grouping things into technical concerns can quickly turn into a giant ball of mud as the ability to properly develop and maintain code in such a project style is directly dependent on the technical expertise and skill of each of the developers on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it&apos;s true, Clean Architecture is not a silver bullet. Using it, or any other code organization approach, is not going to automatically ensure everyone on the team instinctively writes better, more maintainable code. But it&apos;s also not the fault of Clean Architecture that the team produced a mess. It&apos;s the fault of the team. I think you&apos;ll agree with me in a couple of paragraphs...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean Architecture, aka Ports-and-Adapters, has a primary goal of reducing tight coupling from the business rules of the system to infrastructure, and in particular, the database. That&apos;s it. It&apos;s not a panacea and it doesn&apos;t offer feature modularity - &lt;a href=&quot;https://ardalis.com/introducing-modular-monoliths-goldilocks-architecture/&quot;&gt;you need modular monoliths or microservices for that&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkAc6K09pKQ&amp;#x26;t=147s&quot;&gt;I talk about why in this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&apos;s get back to this particular conversation, which is a small case study...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another anecdote about the code the original poster was cleaning up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a ridiculous amount of abstractions.
For example, I have an interface to inject an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IHtmlSanitizer&lt;/code&gt;.
It has one method named &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Sanitize&lt;/code&gt; that takes a string in and a string out.
There&apos;s then an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HtmlSanitizerService&lt;/code&gt;.
Why?
Because CA says that since it uses a a NuGet dependency thus it should be in its own service.
Literally the answer one of my devs gave me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Where does CA say that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&apos;t, but that&apos;s what unexperienced developers understand from it. And left unattended, this is what it produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sure Jan...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what about this team of developers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single developer that&apos;s ever been hired by this company since the inception of this product have all been university graduates with no prior work experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, we might have found &lt;em&gt;the actual problem&lt;/em&gt;. (ding ding ding)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean architecture sucks. No architecture sucks. Microservices architecture sucks. Programming sucks. It all sucks &lt;strong&gt;if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing&lt;/strong&gt;. And if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing, you&apos;re (probably) going to produce a mess. Why? Because you just don&apos;t know any better, yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s exactly what happened with the original poster&apos;s project/team that he inherited. The team had &lt;strong&gt;zero experience&lt;/strong&gt;. They didn&apos;t know how to write good software, much less apply a particular style of architecture, and the result was (in at least some ways) a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&apos;s not even the team&apos;s fault! They were hired with no experience and no mentorship. &lt;strong&gt;They were set up to fail.&lt;/strong&gt; And they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some applications that are simple and don&apos;t require much, if any architecture (what I refer to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://deviq.com/practices/yolo-architecture&quot;&gt;YOLO architecture&lt;/a&gt;). And there are some applications which benefit from minimal structure and just pipelines and handlers (often referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/&quot;&gt;Vertical Slice Architecture&lt;/a&gt; though of course all software benefits from being delivered as &lt;a href=&quot;https://deviq.com/practices/vertical-slices&quot;&gt;Vertical Slides&lt;/a&gt;). And there are some applications that benefit from ports-and-adapters (aka hexagonal, onion, or clean architecture) style architecture, where a significant goal is to shield business logic from persistence and other infrastructure concerns. This is true of almost any application that is being built using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/domain-driven-design-fundamentals&quot;&gt;Domain-Driven Design&lt;/a&gt;, for instance (assuming it warrants using DDD, that is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But new grads don&apos;t know enough to know which is which. Most of them probably aren&apos;t even aware that there are different approaches to these sorts of problems, or when to consider each, or what the tradeoffs are. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://deviq.com/laws/laws-software-architecture&quot;&gt;in software architecture, everything is a tradeoff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is, have at least one experienced developer on the team who can guide the others. And if you don&apos;t have one, hire one. Or bring in a consultant. Or send your team to training as a way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ardalis.com/scaling-your-software-team-develop-vs-hiring/&quot;&gt;scale the team up, rather than out&lt;/a&gt;. Or all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Analogy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say you want to build a house. You have a good idea of the style - you&apos;ve decided to keep it simple and build a Colonial style home. You&apos;re on a budget - so you hire a couple of teens who just graduated from high school and went through the school&apos;s construction training program (they built a shed!). You don&apos;t actually live locally, so you all agree you&apos;ll check in periodically via text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You spend an hour describing the house you have in mind to them, give them a credit card to pick up materials from the hardware store, and fly back home. Over the next year or two, you text back and forth with your contractors, who describe various challenges they&apos;ve encountered but assure you they&apos;re overcoming them with grit and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of years, you&apos;re past ready for this house to be done. But unfortunately, it&apos;s not passing inspection by the local building inspector. After looking over the inspector&apos;s list of faults, you break down and decide to bring in an experienced contractor (or perhaps a building architect) so you can get an assessment of what needs to be fixed in order to make the house livable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking a look at the mess the inexperienced builders produced, the experienced contractor concludes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Colonial style homes suck. You should have built a Ranch.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; that&apos;s the problem 🙄.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no one-size-fits-all architectures, any more than there are one-size-fits-all programming languages. Before blaming whichever architectural style you&apos;re using for your problems, make sure you understand that style, its goals, and its tradeoffs.

Companies and developers often find themselves making critical decisions about whether to adopt new technologies early (bleeding edge), wait until they mature (leading edge or cutting edge), or continue using older, more established technologies (what I&apos;ll call the &lt;strong&gt;dull edge&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;rusting edge&lt;/strong&gt;). Understanding the distinctions and implications of these choices can significantly impact both the development process and business outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bleeding Edge: Innovation at a Risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;bleeding edge&quot; refers to technology that is so new it hasn’t been widely tested or adopted. These are often preview releases or version 1.0 products that promise innovative features and competitive advantages but come with higher risks of instability and lack of support. For startups or tech-centric businesses aiming to disrupt markets, bleeding edge technologies may offer the crucial differentiation needed to stand out. However for more established businesses who hope to build software that will last years, the frequent changes (and outright failures) common to bleeding edge technology are often better avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of bleeding edge technologies that burnt companies who bet on them include &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS&quot;&gt;AngularJS (Angular 1)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/tquo2p/silverlight_5_eol_microsoft_removed_the_links/&quot;&gt;Silverlight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the latest innovations and technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential to gain market advantages by leveraging new capabilities early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher risk of encountering bugs and security vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited community support and resources, such as working samples and documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential for significant changes or discontinuation by vendors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Few developers with experience using the product - everyone must learn on the job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples in .NET in April 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview&quot;&gt;.NET Aspire&lt;/a&gt;. Currently in preview, this technology is likely to be supported by the end of 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0&quot;&gt;.NET 9 preview 3&lt;/a&gt;. Currently ion preview; expected release November 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leading Edge: Established Yet Evolving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading edge technologies are those that have emerged from their initial testing phase and have proven effective in real-world applications. These are typically at least version 2.x releases and have garnered an active community and robust support. Organizations looking for a balance between innovation and reliability often opt for leading edge technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower risk than bleeding edge technologies with a stable release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong community support and ample learning resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular updates and patches from developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Larger pool of experienced developers to draw from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some risk of obsolescence as newer technologies emerge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible limitations if the technology does not evolve quickly enough to meet emerging needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples in .NET in April 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0&quot;&gt;.NET 8&lt;/a&gt;. The latest available version of .NET, also an LTS (Long Term Support) release, with support ending in November 2026.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/overview?view=aspnetcore-8.0&quot;&gt;Minimal APIs&lt;/a&gt;. The latest approach to building web APIs in .NET. First introduced in .NET 6. Currently in active development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-8.0&amp;#x26;tabs=visual-studio&quot;&gt;Razor Pages&lt;/a&gt;. First introduced in .NET Core 2.0. Currently the recommended approach to building server-rendered page-based sites with ASP.NET Core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Dull Edge: Stably Pervasive Yet Fading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No longer sharp or leading, the dull edge refers to tech that is tried and true. It&apos;s still in wide use, but mostly out of inertia. It&apos;s lost its shine. It&apos;s often difficult to upgrade because many systems integrate with or depend on it. It&apos;s dull, metaphorically, because it&apos;s often not as efficient or effective as more modern toolsets. It often carries a stigma among developers of being &apos;dull&apos; to work on or with, due to its age and lack of continued innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widespread use and familiarity within the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stable and reliable for existing applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broad support due to a long history of use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited innovation and updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gradually decreasing community and labor pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing risk of becoming outdated/obsolete (and moving to &lt;em&gt;rusting&lt;/em&gt; edge)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples in .NET as of April 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-8.0&quot;&gt;ASP.NET Core MVC&lt;/a&gt;. Introduced in .NET Core 1.0 in 2016 to replace MVC 5. No longer under active development, but still supported. Replaced by Razor Pages, minimal APIs, and Blazor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rusting Edge: Declining Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;rusting edge&quot; describes technologies that are on the decline. They are often nearing the end of their lifecycle but may still be supported and used within many organizations. These technologies are typically well-understood, stable, and have extensive documentation, making them a safe choice for critical systems that require reliability over innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High stability and reliability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive documentation and widespread knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictable performance and fewer surprises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited or no updates and improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shrinking community and expertise pool. The best talent typically keeps up with tech trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk of eventual obsolescence requiring eventual migration or overhaul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of commercial support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples in April 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started&quot;&gt;.NET Framework MVC&lt;/a&gt;. MVC 5 is the latest version, released in 2013. Still supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/tutorial-your-first-web-api&quot;&gt;.NET Framework Web APIs&lt;/a&gt;. Version 2 is the latest version, released in 2013. Still supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET&quot;&gt;ASP.NET Web Forms&lt;/a&gt;. First released as simply &quot;ASP.NET&quot; in 2002. Still supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro&quot;&gt;(Visual) FoxPro&lt;/a&gt;. First released in the 1980s and acquired by Microsoft in the 1990s. Its final release was in 2007, and extended &lt;strong&gt;support ended in 2015&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making the Right Choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding which edge to lean towards requires a strategic assessment of an organization&apos;s goals, risk tolerance, and market position. Innovation-driven companies might prefer the bleeding edge to stay competitive, while those in the most heavily regulated industries might find dull edge tech more appropriate. Most will find the leading edge a safe yet progressive choice, with an optimal mix of risks and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, it would be a mistake to start a new project, expected to be maintained for many years, on a &lt;em&gt;rusting edge&lt;/em&gt; technology. Such applications often find themselves obsolete by the time the ship their first version. They have a hard time finding support as well as developers willing to work on dead end technology, and while initially developer resources may be abundant, that pool tends to quickly dry up as experienced developers retire or shift to working with more modern technologies. Thus, companies often must pay a premium to lure developers into working on rusting edge technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, whether you’re pioneering with bleeding edge, progressing with leading edge, or maintaining with rusting edge technology, each has its place in the ecosystem of software development. The key is to align your technology strategy with your business objectives and the specific needs of your projects and teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Watch the video above to see actual timings of starting with and without debugging. Vote for this &lt;a href=&quot;https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Change-Menu-Text-from-Start-Debugging-/10639783&quot;&gt;feature request to make Run vs Debug more obvious in Visual Studio.&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work with a lot of different .NET developers as a trainer, architect, and consultant with &lt;a href=&quot;https://nimblepros.com&quot;&gt;NimblePros&lt;/a&gt;. One thing that I&apos;m frequently pointing out to them is the difference in startup speed for their applications when launching from Visual Studio. Many, I would even say most, .NET developers have developed &quot;muscle memory&quot; of hitting F5 (or clicking the &quot;Play&quot; button) in order to launch their applications. And why not? This was the only toolbar button available for many years, and F5 is a simple enough key to remember, and is literally called &quot;Start&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The (potential) problem is, the default start behavior actually means &quot;Debug&quot;. Which means launching the Debugger, totally overhauling the UI of Visual Studio in the process, and adding often significant delay to the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative is to &quot;Start without Debugging&quot; (also known as &quot;Run&quot; everywhere else but in Visual Studio), which is now available using a hollow &quot;Play&quot; icon on the toolbar as well as via keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+F5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which one do you use by default? If you&apos;re in the F5/Play by default camp, do me a favor and try Ctrl+F5/Hollow Play with your main app you&apos;re always working in and let me know in the comments if it makes a difference. Here&apos;s what one (of many) reply on Twitter/X found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/run-incomparably-faster-visual-studio.png&quot; alt=&quot;ctrl+F5 incomparably faster than F5&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use the toolbar, think of it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/start-slow-fast.png&quot; alt=&quot;Start is slow; Start without debugging is fast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like how Rider does it, which is also how the dotnet CLI works. Just call it &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Run&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; if you want to run the app. Call it &quot;Debug&quot; if you want to debug the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&apos;t need to make it overcomplicated, especially for a menu item which should just be a simple verb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this &quot;Start the application but this time don&apos;t attach a debugger or do anything else but run it, ok?&quot; menu text. And there&apos;s no need to confuse things with &quot;Start the debugger and the application and attach the debugger to it all with this button&quot;, either. It&apos;s too verbose. It&apos;s just more words when &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Debug&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; suffices. (Yeah, I know it&apos;s really &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; &quot;Start Debugging&quot; and &quot;Start Without Debugging&quot; but that&apos;s still obviously more verbose than necessary; I&apos;m exaggerating to make a point)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio already has a precedent for this, too, with tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/run-tests-debug-tests-visual-studio.png&quot; alt=&quot;Run Tests or Debug Tests&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there&apos;s not menu option to &quot;Start Tests With Debugger&quot; or &quot;Start Tests Without Debugger&quot; because that&apos;s completely unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Help Future Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok so why do I care, and why should you? My personal mission is to help developers write better code, faster. Starting the program you&apos;re writing is almost certainly a part of your development inner loop, and as such &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1205/&quot;&gt;relatively small gains can quickly add up since the activity is occurring so frequently&lt;/a&gt;. And the investment in this case is minimal - literally just a tiny bit of education so developers can be intentional about how they want to run (or sometimes debug) their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s almost certainly too much of a change at this point for Visual Studio to change the behavior of F5/Play. But what they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do is change the menu text, so that it would become clear to developers that one option is for Debugging and the other is for Running. I ran &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ardalis/status/1780290422213915131&quot;&gt;a poll which you can see (and participate in if you&apos;re quick) what my corner of Twitter thought about this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also opened up &lt;a href=&quot;https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Change-Menu-Text-from-Start-Debugging-/10639783&quot;&gt;this change request with Visual Studio&lt;/a&gt;, which you can view and vote up if you agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about VS Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio Code is a weird hybrid of Visual Studio and Rider when it comes to the names and text they use for their menus. Whereas in Visual Studio &lt;strong&gt;running your app&lt;/strong&gt; which should be one of the most common things folks do is hidden behind a top level &quot;Debug&quot; menu option, VS Code has a top level menu item called &quot;Run&quot;. Makes sense so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then under that menu things look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/vs-code-run-menu.png&quot; alt=&quot;vs code run menu&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might expect that the first and default option under the &quot;Run&quot; menu would be &quot;Run&quot; or &quot;Run the App&quot; but no doubt because of compatibility with Visual Studio it&apos;s &quot;Start Debugging&quot; (which doesn&apos;t even mention &quot;Run&quot;). And then for the second option it&apos;s &quot;Run Without Debugging&quot; which again is just an overly verbose way of saying &quot;Run&quot;. Bonus points for using &quot;Run&quot; instead of &quot;Start&quot; for the non-debugging case, but weirdly inconsistent use of &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Run&quot; in the two options...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I mostly just use the terminal and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dotnet run&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dotnet watch run&lt;/code&gt; when I&apos;m in VS Code, so these don&apos;t make a huge difference in my day to day coding. But some folks in the comments of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxfAoUHH400&quot;&gt;my YouTube video on this topic&lt;/a&gt; asked, so I thought I&apos;d include some info here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/W4n9x_qGpT4?si=1ryxzqqMlRM3Sx8w&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&apos;s a DTO?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DTO is a Data Transfer Object. Its job is to transfer data, and it can be used both to &lt;em&gt;send&lt;/em&gt; data and to &lt;em&gt;receive&lt;/em&gt; it. Often, data transferred will use different types (possibly even different programming languages and technology stacks) on each end of the transfer. The only thing you can count on transferring is the &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; - nothing else. Which leads to the first rule for DTOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/DTOs-Rule-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rule 1. DTOs only contain data. No logic or behavior.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DTOs should be super easy to work with, as well as to author. They do not benefit from encapsulation and typically they should avoid using inheritance as well (hiding things isn&apos;t something we want with DTOs, and reuse is overrated, too). Which leads us to the second rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/DTOs-Rule-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rule 2. DTOs do not enforce encapsulation. They don&amp;#x27;t need private/protected members.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, even though DTOs don&apos;t need encapsulation, it&apos;s still generally preferred to use C# properties rather than fields. By default, serializers and other language features work on properties but not fields (though you can configure this). Rule 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/DTOs-Rule-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rule 3. DTOs should use properties (not fields).&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what should you name them? An obvious naming convention is simply to add &quot;DTO&quot; (or &quot;Dto&quot;) to the end of whatever sort of thing is being described. While this works and is fine for the most basic representation, there are many cases where you should use a more descriptive name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many common types used in modern dotnet apps can (and usually should) be modeled as DTOs. These include API request and response objects, commands and queries, events, and more. In such cases, suffix the type with the more specific name (e.g. &quot;CreateUserRequest&quot; instead of just &quot;UserDTO&quot;). See rule 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/DTOs-Rule-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rule 4. DTOs should only use &amp;#x22;-DTO&amp;#x22; suffix as a last resort. Prefer more descriptive names.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the things that should be DTOs, and should be named according to their particular use, rather than naming them &quot;FooDTO&quot;, as rule 5:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/DTOs-Rule-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rule 5. These should be modeled as DTOs: API Request/Response types, MVC ViewModel objects, Database query result objects, Messages like commands, events, and queries.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s actually quite a bit more to say about DTOs, like how to map them, where they should live, and what types they should reference, but I&apos;ll save that for a follow-up article/video.&lt;/p&gt;
