<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-buy-glastonbury-2024-tickets"><span>How to buy Glastonbury 2024 tickets</span></h2>
<p>In an effort to clamp down on ticket touting, anyone who would like to attend the festival <strong>needs to be registered on the website </strong>prior to the ticket sale. The registration period has unfortunately passed, so if you haven't already registered, you're out of luck. Unless you're under 13 years old. More on that lower down.</p><p>Music lovers who successfully filled out the registration form in time can soon buy Glastonbury 2025 tickets <strong>exclusively via the </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://glastonbury.seetickets.com" target="_blank"><strong>event's official website</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-when-is-glastonbury-2025"><span>When is Glastonbury 2025?</span></h2>
<p>As tradition, Glastonbury 2025 is set to take place over the last week of June, specifically <strong>from Wednesday June 25 to Sunday June 29 2025</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-can-i-buy-glastonbury-tickets-from-overseas"><span>Can I buy Glastonbury tickets from overseas?</span></h2>
<p>Yes, there are no limitations on where you can buy Glastonbury 2025 tickets.</p><p>As we have seen before, changing your device country location with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/most-secure-vpns-best-encryption">secure VPN</a> service could actually boost your chances of bagging your entrance card.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-kind-of-glastonbury-2025-tickets-are-there"><span>What kind of Glastonbury 2025 tickets are there?</span></h2>
<p>Besides the combo of festival ticket and coach fare, there are many types of entrances you can choose from.</p><p>You can pay an additional fee for adding a car park pass to your entrance. That's done during the first week of April 2025 and the price has not been confirmed yet. Last year, it was £55.</p><p>Campervan tickets were £200 for a standard size in 2024 with larger pitches at £300.</p><p>You can even hire tipis to share with your family and friends – each can accommodate up to six adults. This costs £1750 to hire, to pay in full at the time of booking.</p><p>There will also be some Sunday tickets exclusively available for Somerset residents.</p><p>On top of these, there is also Glastonbury pre-erected accommodation available at a later sale date with Sticklinch and Worth View fields providing pods, scout tents, huts, and more.</p><p>Campervans, tipis, and accommodation will be available to purchase in a separate sale in the weeks following the general ticket sale.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-do-i-get-to-glastonbury-2025"><span>How do I get to Glastonbury 2025</span></h2>
<p>As festival organizers point out, coaches are the best way to get to the Glastonbury festival. The event's official partner, National Express, will run services from over 70 locations directly to the festival site. You can check and book your route <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nationalexpress.com/en/events/glastonbury" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>If you are thinking of coming by train, the closest station is Castle Cary. Here, there will be a free shuttle bus running throughout the event days.</p><p>Those coming by car or campervan should keep in mind that, despite the name, the festival is not actually located in the town of Glastonbury. As with previous events, Glastonbury 2025 will be held at Worthy Farm which is in Pilton, in Somerset.</p><p>Ticket + Coach options go on sale earlier than the general sale and are a great way to secure your place at the festival if you're happy to travel by coach. Costs depend on where you're coming from.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-glastonbury-children-s-tickets"><span>Glastonbury children's tickets</span></h2>
<p>If you are thinking of heading to the festival with all your family, good news: kids under 13 go free! No ticket required. Just show up and make sure the parents have tickets, of course.</p><p>Glastonbury festival is a popular destination for families, too. So, nothing to worry about. Just make sure to keep an eye on the youngest family members at all times.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-get-glastonbury-tickets-what-to-do-if-you-miss-out"><span>Get Glastonbury tickets: what to do if you miss out</span></h2>
<p>If you miss out on the registration end date, don't panic. There's still another chance around April when returned tickets get resold. So, you still have a chance to land your Glastonbury 2025 spot. Plus, you can always work there and get in for free.</p>

The registration period has unfortunately passed, so if you haven't already registered, you're out of luck. Unless you're under 13 years old. More on that lower down.</p><p>Music lovers who successfully filled out the registration form in time can soon buy Glastonbury 2025 tickets <strong>exclusively via the </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://glastonbury.seetickets.com" target="_blank"><strong>event's official website</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-when-is-glastonbury-2025"><span>When is Glastonbury 2025?</span></h2>
<p>As tradition, Glastonbury 2025 is set to take place over the last week of June, specifically <strong>from Wednesday June 25 to Sunday June 29 2025</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-can-i-buy-glastonbury-tickets-from-overseas"><span>Can I buy Glastonbury tickets from overseas?</span></h2>
<p>Yes, there are no limitations on where you can buy Glastonbury 2025 tickets.</p><p>As we have seen before, changing your device country location with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/most-secure-vpns-best-encryption">secure VPN</a> service could actually boost your chances of bagging your entrance card.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-kind-of-glastonbury-2025-tickets-are-there"><span>What kind of Glastonbury 2025 tickets are there?</span></h2>
<p>Besides the combo of festival ticket and coach fare, there are many types of entrances you can choose from.</p><p>You can pay an additional fee for adding a car park pass to your entrance. That's done during the first week of April 2025 and the price has not been confirmed yet. Last year, it was £55.</p><p>Campervan tickets were £200 for a standard size in 2024 with larger pitches at £300.</p><p>You can even hire tipis to share with your family and friends – each can accommodate up to six adults. This costs £1750 to hire, to pay in full at the time of booking.</p><p>There will also be some Sunday tickets exclusively available for Somerset residents.</p><p>On top of these, there is also Glastonbury pre-erected accommodation available at a later sale date with Sticklinch and Worth View fields providing pods, scout tents, huts, and more.</p><p>Campervans, tipis, and accommodation will be available to purchase in a separate sale in the weeks following the general ticket sale.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-do-i-get-to-glastonbury-2025"><span>How do I get to Glastonbury 2025</span></h2>
<p>As festival organizers point out, coaches are the best way to get to the Glastonbury festival. The event's official partner, National Express, will run services from over 70 locations directly to the festival site. You can check and book your route <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nationalexpress.com/en/events/glastonbury" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>If you are thinking of coming by train, the closest station is Castle Cary. Here, there will be a free shuttle bus running throughout the event days.</p><p>Those coming by car or campervan should keep in mind that, despite the name, the festival is not actually located in the town of Glastonbury. As with previous events, Glastonbury 2025 will be held at Worthy Farm which is in Pilton, in Somerset.</p><p>Ticket + Coach options go on sale earlier than the general sale and are a great way to secure your place at the festival if you're happy to travel by coach. Costs depend on where you're coming from.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-glastonbury-children-s-tickets"><span>Glastonbury children's tickets</span></h2>
<p>If you are thinking of heading to the festival with all your family, good news: kids under 13 go free! No ticket required. Just show up and make sure the parents have tickets, of course.</p><p>Glastonbury festival is a popular destination for families, too. So, nothing to worry about. Just make sure to keep an eye on the youngest family members at all times.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-get-glastonbury-tickets-what-to-do-if-you-miss-out"><span>Get Glastonbury tickets: what to do if you miss out</span></h2>
<p>If you miss out on the registration end date, don't panic. There's still another chance around April when returned tickets get resold. So, you still have a chance to land your Glastonbury 2025 spot. Plus, you can always work there and get in for free.</p>

<p>Dynabook has introduced two new models to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dynabook.com/mobile-notebook/x-series/index.html">premium laptop lineup</a>, both powered by Intel’s 13th-generation Core P processors.</p><p>The X8/Y is equipped with the Intel Core i7-1360P, while the X6/Y features the Intel Core i5-1340P.</p><p>Weighing approximately 937 grams, the laptops are designed for portability while also meeting MIL-SPEC standards, featuring a magnesium alloy body.

<h2 id="microsoft-productivity-software-included-2">Microsoft productivity software included</h2>
<p>Both laptops offer a self-replaceable battery system, allowing users to change the battery as needed.

<hr>
<p>LinkedIn has confirmed it will be discontinuing Audio Events, its audio-only broadcast feature, in an effort to simplify its live event tools.</p><p>From December 2, 2024, users will no longer be able to create standalone Audio Events on the platform.</p><p>Users will instead have to use the LinkedIn Live service, which includes video and audio broadcasting supported by third-party streaming tools.</p>
<h2 id="linkedin-audio-events-being-discontinued-2">LinkedIn Audio Events being discontinued</h2>
<p>The company confirmed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a7144422" target="_blank">support article</a>: “We are updating our live event creation experience, bringing together our Audio Events and LinkedIn Live into a single entrypoint.”</p><p>Although users will no longer be able to create native Audio Events from December 2, Audio Events scheduled up until December 31, 2024 will still be supported. Users who need more time to find alternative solutions should schedule the Audio Events they need between now and the end of the year before the December 2 deadline.</p><p>The support page points affected users seeking “trusted third-party streaming partners” to a separate LinkedIn Live Overview <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a554240" target="_blank">support page</a>.</p><p>LinkedIn Live offers real-time commenting for audience engagement and automatically records events to make them available for replaying and sharing on profiles or company pages after the event.</p><p>The Microsoft-owned platform’s live broadcasting efforts first came about with the launch of LinkedIn Live in 2019. Initially rolled out on an invite-only beta basis for US users, it focused on live video experiences, but it has since incorporated streaming options for conferences, product launches and Q&As.</p><p>When it launched, LinkedIn director of product management Pete Davies said: “Video is the fastest growing format on our platform right now, and the one most likely to get people talking.”</p>

<hr>
<p>LinkedIn has confirmed it will be discontinuing Audio Events, its audio-only broadcast feature, in an effort to simplify its live event tools.</p><p>From December 2, 2024, users will no longer be able to create standalone Audio Events on the platform.</p><p>Users will instead have to use the LinkedIn Live service, which includes video and audio broadcasting supported by third-party streaming tools.</p>
<h2 id="linkedin-audio-events-being-discontinued-6">LinkedIn Audio Events being discontinued</h2>
<p>The company confirmed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a7144422" target="_blank">support article</a>: “We are updating our live event creation experience, bringing together our Audio Events and LinkedIn Live into a single entrypoint.”</p><p>Although users will no longer be able to create native Audio Events from December 2, Audio Events scheduled up until December 31, 2024 will still be supported. Users who need more time to find alternative solutions should schedule the Audio Events they need between now and the end of the year before the December 2 deadline.</p><p>The support page points affected users seeking “trusted third-party streaming partners” to a separate LinkedIn Live Overview <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a554240" target="_blank">support page</a>.</p><p>LinkedIn Live offers real-time commenting for audience engagement and automatically records events to make them available for replaying and sharing on profiles or company pages after the event.</p><p>The Microsoft-owned platform’s live broadcasting efforts first came about with the launch of LinkedIn Live in 2019. Initially rolled out on an invite-only beta basis for US users, it focused on live video experiences, but it has since incorporated streaming options for conferences, product launches and Q&As.</p><p>When it launched, LinkedIn director of product management Pete Davies said: “Video is the fastest growing format on our platform right now, and the one most likely to get people talking.”</p>

<p><strong>Is Black Friday the best time to buy Dyson products?</strong></p><p>Generally speaking, yes. Dyson products are characterized not only by their quality, but also by the lofty price tag, and the fact there are rarely significant discounts. Luckily, you've got a week until the deals officially launch, so there's time to mull over your options.</p><p>While we'll sometimes see small price drops during other major sales, Black Friday is often the only sales event during which we'll see discounts of any great significance.It's worth highlighting, however, that truly great deals on certain devices like the Airwrap are especially few and far between.</p><p>Sometimes, even if a deal isn't as good as one we've seen previously, it's worth snagging an Airwrap if you've had it on your list for a few years.</p>

<p>If you want a mid-range model from Dyson's range of powerful vacuums, consider the Dyson V11. It packs a host of helpful features; an easy-empty bin, informative LCD screen and decent battery life, though doesn't feature some of the super-smarts seen in some newer models. It's plenty powerful and perfect for pet owners thanks to its detangling motor bar that works well across hardwood floors and carpets. You can also transform it into a handheld vac for quick and convenient clean-ups.</p><p>We've yet to see the Dyson V11 drop any lower than its current price at Amazon - and the UK has the V11 Extra at a fantastically low price, too.</p><p><strong>Dyson V11 Cordless Vacuum:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FDyson-Origin-Cordless-Vacuum-Nickel%2Fdp%2FB00FZPRUTY%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fcrid%3D3IKCWQX0EZFI6%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.-sm5xyK2_BdSOYS_4CQBSYXporUziPVNmAnc21vQ3_C_L-v7pNaPeoaO6WmsJ5YHxYP8bkXXZ4W9mpBOBYz28GZAfHQ2c7e-TNh7HswVcFdvi3w3ItBG7AyvhXcdoSzKWgKEekDeuVR-SHteHZzhFGeBQgkvCokrcO15xs3XxDSYhKOeSxDAXKeiIGGw9aNO1GtPiEWa7VqSs0yyH4MTIxilllae0Ttp9L3n4olPRK8.SoJ_wfs5NHTVjzWbMYLY3k8rJeg7bbRsA2R4NyWRGZ4%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Ddyson%2Bv11%26qid%3D1732197240%26sprefix%3Ddyson%2Bv1%252Caps%252C227%26sr%3D8-1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-gb-8248256921440479107-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><del>was US$569.99</del></a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FDyson-Origin-Cordless-Vacuum-Nickel%2Fdp%2FB00FZPRUTY%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fcrid%3D3IKCWQX0EZFI6%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.-sm5xyK2_BdSOYS_4CQBSYXporUziPVNmAnc21vQ3_C_L-v7pNaPeoaO6WmsJ5YHxYP8bkXXZ4W9mpBOBYz28GZAfHQ2c7e-TNh7HswVcFdvi3w3ItBG7AyvhXcdoSzKWgKEekDeuVR-SHteHZzhFGeBQgkvCokrcO15xs3XxDSYhKOeSxDAXKeiIGGw9aNO1GtPiEWa7VqSs0yyH4MTIxilllae0Ttp9L3n4olPRK8.SoJ_wfs5NHTVjzWbMYLY3k8rJeg7bbRsA2R4NyWRGZ4%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Ddyson%2Bv11%26qid%3D1732197240%26sprefix%3Ddyson%2Bv1%252Caps%252C227%26sr%3D8-1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-gb-8248256921440479107-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"> <strong>now $349.99</strong> <strong>at Amazon US<br></strong></a><strong><br>Dyson V11 Extra Cordless Vacuum: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/dyson-v11-extra-cordless-vacuum-cleaner-red-and-purple-10270009.html"><del>was £499.99</del> <strong>now £349.99 at Currys UK</strong></a></p>

<p>The hairdryer that really kickstarted Dyson's astronomic leap into the haircare market is still near-unmatched, offering impressively speedy drying times and a comfortable drying experience thanks to its and innovative form factor. Plus, you can also use the flyaway attachment (sold seperately) to reduce unnecessary frizz in your 'do thanks to its coanda airflow technology.</p><p>Typically, it's a pretty pricey device, especially given there are some decent dupes now available. However, Black Friday brings the heat, knocking £80 from its list price.</p><p><strong>Dyson Supersonic: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://john-lewis-and-partners.pxf.io/c/221109/871855/12148?subId1=trd-us-9277318564773930246&sharedId=hawk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fdyson-supersonic-hair-dryer-copper%2Fp109113071" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><del>was £329.99</del></a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://john-lewis-and-partners.pxf.io/c/221109/871855/12148?subId1=trd-us-9277318564773930246&sharedId=hawk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fdyson-supersonic-hair-dryer-copper%2Fp109113071" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"> <strong>now £249.99</strong> <strong>at John Lewis</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Are Dyson haircare devices worth it?</strong></p><p>I've tested almost every device in Dyson's haircare range, and let me tell you, they are <em>good. </em>However, at list price, you're mostly paying off Dyson's R&D department for their hard work in innovating hair care. Thankfully, many devices see at least $/£100 discounted during Black Friday.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dyson-supersonic-uk">Dyson Supersonic hairdryer</a> started it all, releasing as Dyson's first hair care device in 2012, and at twelve years old it sees some of the best Black Friday discounts from Dyson's range. It offers supremely speedy drying times, convenient magnetic attachments and sleek results. It still stands as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-hair-dryer-5-hair-dryers-for-smooth-and-shiny-styles">best hair dryers</a> available, though the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/home/hair-care/dyson-supersonic-nural-review-tech-packed-and-time-saving">Supersonic Nural</a> packs more smart features like Scalp Protection and the energy-saving low power mode - however, we're unlikely to see this discounted for 2024.</p><p>In case you missed it, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dyson-airwrap-styler-review">Dyson Airwrap</a> remains a hugely popular and virally successful multi-styler, with the brand releasing multiple new editions to accommodate different hair types and lengths. I use mine almost every day, and I've definitely noticed my hair is less damaged than when I previously used a conventional hair dryer - however, for some coarser or thicker hair types, styling doesn't hold as long as with ceramic hair tools. At its list price, it's a big investment, however, we've seen prices drop by up to $120 in the US.</p><p>Some devices such as its straighteners (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/home/hair-care/dyson-airstrait-review">Dyson Airstrait</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dyson-corrale-review">Dyson Coralle</a>) are certainly innovative, but won't be a top pick for everyone, and neither typically see huge discounts over Black Friday. They work well for some specific hair types; typically medium thickness straighter or wavy hair that isn't too porous, but otherwise might not do the job as well as conventional ceramic plates. Still, the lofty price tag makes them inferior to market-leading, traditional straighteners like our current top recommendation, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ghd-unplugged">GHD Unplugged</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UK deal: </strong>A personal recommendation here, the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09 is a fantastic all-in-one purifier, heater and fan, earning it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dyson-purifier-hot-cool-formaldehyde-hp09">4.5* in my review. </a>Until recently, I lived in a flat with some pretty gnarly black mould, and this bad boy gave me more than just peace of mind.</p><p>In addition to cleaning your air and keeping it at a comfortable temperature, the near-live air quality data (shown both on its Liquid Crystal Display and companion app) is a real boon and helped me identify some potentially harmful products in my home. Plus, it integrates with a variety of smart home devices, meaning you can set up smart automations to cool, heat or purify your home - though you'll need a separate air quality sensor for this, as unfortunately data from the device isn't sent to your smart home hub.</p><p><strong>Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9395390?clickSR=slp:term:dyson:15:60:1"><del>was £700</del> now £550 at Argos</a></p>

<p><strong>Is Black Friday the best time to buy Dyson products?</strong></p><p>Generally speaking, yes. Dyson products are characterized not only by their quality, but also by the lofty price tag, and the fact there are rarely significant discounts. Luckily, you've got a week until the deals officially launch, so there's time to mull over your options.</p><p>While we'll sometimes see small price drops during other major sales, Black Friday is often the only sales event during which we'll see discounts of any great significance.It's worth highlighting, however, that truly great deals on certain devices like the Airwrap are especially few and far between.</p><p>Sometimes, even if a deal isn't as good as one we've seen previously, it's worth snagging an Airwrap if you've had it on your list for a few years.</p>

<p>The hairdryer that really kickstarted Dyson's astronomic leap into the haircare market is still near-unmatched, offering impressively speedy drying times and a comfortable drying experience thanks to its and innovative form factor. Plus, you can also use the flyaway attachment (sold seperately) to reduce unnecessary frizz in your 'do thanks to its coanda airflow technology.</p><p>Typically, it's a pretty pricey device, especially given there are some decent dupes now available. However, Black Friday brings the heat, knocking £80 from its list price.</p><p><strong>Dyson Supersonic: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://john-lewis-and-partners.pxf.io/c/221109/871855/12148?subId1=trd-us-9277318564773930246&sharedId=hawk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fdyson-supersonic-hair-dryer-copper%2Fp109113071" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><del>was £329.99</del></a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://john-lewis-and-partners.pxf.io/c/221109/871855/12148?subId1=trd-us-9277318564773930246&sharedId=hawk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fdyson-supersonic-hair-dryer-copper%2Fp109113071" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"> <strong>now £249.99</strong> <strong>at John Lewis</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Are Dyson haircare devices worth it?</strong></p><p>I've tested almost every device in Dyson's haircare range, and let me tell you, they are <em>good. </em>However, at list price, you're mostly paying off Dyson's R&D department for their hard work in innovating hair care. Thankfully, many devices see at least $/£100 discounted during Black Friday.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dyson-supersonic-uk">Dyson Supersonic hairdryer</a> started it all, releasing as Dyson's first hair care device in 2012, and at twelve years old it sees some of the best Black Friday discounts from Dyson's range. It offers supremely speedy drying times, convenient magnetic attachments and sleek results. It still stands as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-hair-dryer-5-hair-dryers-for-smooth-and-shiny-styles">best hair dryers</a> available, though the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/home/hair-care/dyson-supersonic-nural-review-tech-packed-and-time-saving">Supersonic Nural</a> packs more smart features like Scalp Protection and the energy-saving low power mode - however, we're unlikely to see this discounted for 2024.</p><p>In case you missed it, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dyson-airwrap-styler-review">Dyson Airwrap</a> remains a hugely popular and virally successful multi-styler, with the brand releasing multiple new editions to accommodate different hair types and lengths. I use mine almost every day, and I've definitely noticed my hair is less damaged than when I previously used a conventional hair dryer - however, for some coarser or thicker hair types, styling doesn't hold as long as with ceramic hair tools. At its list price, it's a big investment, however, we've seen prices drop by up to $120 in the US.</p><p>Some devices such as its straighteners (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/home/hair-care/dyson-airstrait-review">Dyson Airstrait</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dyson-corrale-review">Dyson Coralle</a>) are certainly innovative, but won't be a top pick for everyone, and neither typically see huge discounts over Black Friday. They work well for some specific hair types; typically medium thickness straighter or wavy hair that isn't too porous, but otherwise might not do the job as well as conventional ceramic plates. Still, the lofty price tag makes them inferior to market-leading, traditional straighteners like our current top recommendation, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ghd-unplugged">GHD Unplugged</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UK deal: </strong>A personal recommendation here, the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09 is a fantastic all-in-one purifier, heater and fan, earning it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dyson-purifier-hot-cool-formaldehyde-hp09">4.5* in my review. </a>Until recently, I lived in a flat with some pretty gnarly black mould, and this bad boy gave me more than just peace of mind.</p><p>In addition to cleaning your air and keeping it at a comfortable temperature, the near-live air quality data (shown both on its Liquid Crystal Display and companion app) is a real boon and helped me identify some potentially harmful products in my home. Plus, it integrates with a variety of smart home devices, meaning you can set up smart automations to cool, heat or purify your home - though you'll need a separate air quality sensor for this, as unfortunately data from the device isn't sent to your smart home hub.</p><p><strong>Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9395390?clickSR=slp:term:dyson:15:60:1"><del>was £700</del> now £550 at Argos</a></p>

<p>However, according to Malinauskas, it seems that the government aims to prevent users from accessing certain websites/services by blocking VPN access for people who are not registered as VPN users in Pakistan.</p><p>Just a week ago, in fact, Pakistan's top religious body said that using a VPN service to access blocked content <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/vpn/using-a-vpn-is-against-islamic-law-says-pakistan-religious-chief">goes against Islamic law</a>, calling for a ban. The Ministry of Interior also called to block all "illegal" VPNs, claiming that terrorists use these tools.</p><p>"This further contributes to a worrying trend of internet censorship and limitation of people’s digital rights in Pakistan," said Malinauskas.</p><p>As Surfshark's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=61&aff_id=1691&source=trd&aff_click_id=trdpro-us-4149504738348494431&aff_sub2=hawk-article-url&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsurfshark.com%2Fresearch%2Finternet-censorship%2F" target="_blank"> Internet Shutdown Tracker</a> shows, Pakistan imposed six nationwide internet restrictions in 2024 alone. Many popular social media apps cannot be accessed without a VPN until this day.</p><p>Instagram was the first to be blocked in May 2023, X went dark starting in February this year, and then Facebook in July. Authorities also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/vpn/pakistan-blocks-bluesky-amid-popularity-surge">blocked Bluesky</a> on Thursday as the platform gained momentum worldwide as X's alternative.</p>

<p>However, according to Malinauskas, it seems that the government aims to prevent users from accessing certain websites/services by blocking VPN access for people who are not registered as VPN users in Pakistan.</p><p>Just a week ago, in fact, Pakistan's top religious body said that using a VPN service to access blocked content <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/vpn/using-a-vpn-is-against-islamic-law-says-pakistan-religious-chief">goes against Islamic law</a>, calling for a ban. The Ministry of Interior also called to block all "illegal" VPNs, claiming that terrorists use these tools.</p><p>"This further contributes to a worrying trend of internet censorship and limitation of people’s digital rights in Pakistan," said Malinauskas.</p><p>As Surfshark's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=61&aff_id=1691&source=trd&aff_click_id=trdpro-us-4149504738348494431&aff_sub2=hawk-article-url&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsurfshark.com%2Fresearch%2Finternet-censorship%2F" target="_blank"> Internet Shutdown Tracker</a> shows, Pakistan imposed six nationwide internet restrictions in 2024 alone. Many popular social media apps cannot be accessed without a VPN until this day.</p><p>Instagram was the first to be blocked in May 2023, X went dark starting in February this year, and then Facebook in July. Authorities also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/vpn/pakistan-blocks-bluesky-amid-popularity-surge">blocked Bluesky</a> on Thursday as the platform gained momentum worldwide as X's alternative.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href=""></a>The Black Friday PS5 deals and PS5 Pro discounts (there are genuinely some!) are part of the wider PS5 deals we'll see later this month, and there should be a host of discounts on offer across complementing games and accessories.</p><p>• <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-gb-1176294662635512308-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">See all of today's best deals at Amazon</a></p><p>While the PS5 Pro is brand new and we are still not expecting too much in terms of discounts on the machine itself - especially on the US side we're hopeful of seeing some tempting propositions on accessories and games that are adjacent to it.</p><p>Along with the shavings off the PS5 Pro price in the UK, I'm also quietly hoping for some more value offerings on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5-pro-review">PS5 Pro</a> in terms of bundles: perhaps some listings that include the disc drive and vertical stand at a reduced retail price. This would increase the value proposition and help offer a way into the new console in a more fulsome way - and with it being so hard to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5/where-to-buy-ps5-pro-disc-drive-ps5-stand">buy a PS5 disc drive</a> right now, this would be incredibly welcome.</p><p>Anyway, be it such bundles, discounts on the best enhanced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5/ps5-pro-games-list">PS5 Pro games</a>, or other products that will enhance your PS5 and PS5 Pro experience, we're here to gather up all the best deals as we steamroll our way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-sales">Black Friday</a> next week.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to our coverage of this year's Black Friday PS5 Pro deals and sales. if you've been looking for a place to browse for deals on the new Pro console itself (hopefully) or any of the best enhanced games, or accessories to team with your PS5 Pro then you're in the right place.</p><p>While we're hopeful, but not expectant, of some better value offerings on the Pro itself - perhaps via bundles that include extras like the disc drive - we're definitely going to see price cuts on some top games, as well as a plethora of accessories from TVs to headsets, and from controllers to storage.</p><p>I recently reviewed the PS5 Pro so know a thing or two about it and what it can offer you - and what it needs to be better value - and I've also been a PlayStation and gaming hardware editor and writer for years, covering the PS5 launch and stock shortage, and the PlayStation Portal stock debacle too, to name a couple of examples. Importantly, though, I'm also another PlayStation-head who loves to save money on games and accessories so I know what makes a good PS5 Pro deal and PS5 discount. So sit back, and let's begin.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-black-friday-ps5-pro-deals-will-we-see-2">What kind of Black Friday PS5 Pro deals will we see? </h2>
<p>Particularly given the PS5 Pro is so fresh and brand new, you may be wondering what kind of deals I'm going to be concentrating on here - which is a fair question!</p><p>While I don't necessarily expect to see any discounts on the console itself, I am just a tiny bit hopeful of seeing some better value offerings on it. I'd really love to see some retailers bundle up the disc drive and vertical stand with the Pro and shave some money off the price tag, for example. These kinds of bundles will still be expensive, of course, but might be enough to convince folks to jump in and get everything they need in one hit.</p><p>Adjacent to the console itself, on things like PS5 Pro games, and PS5 Pro accessories, is <em>definitely</em> where we are going to see discounts and deals galore. PlayStation first-party games, and major games of the past couple of years which are Pro enhanced will drop in price , so look out for discounts on the likes of <em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>, the <em>Horizon</em> games, and <em>Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart</em> (and more).</p><p>Then we're <em>definitely</em> going to see discounts on accessories and complementing hardware to the PS5 Pro too. Headsets, controllers, SSDs, racing wheels, TVs, monitors, and everything else will have prices slashed so look out for those - and we'll be highlighting a bunch here - throughout the sales period.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="QgSnzyvroeb9QSSoXcfJBi" name="1730830073.jpg" alt="The PS5 Pro box on a wooden desk in front of a white brick background and next to a potted plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QgSnzyvroeb9QSSoXcfJBi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having said that, the first price I need to tell you about is the best price on the PS5 Pro itself right now.</p><p>In the US, the best price we can find is a mere 99 cents off the listing price of $699.99. It's not really a discount at this point, but getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/PLAYSTATION-PS5-PRO-CONSOLE/11839818124">PS5 Pro for $699 at Walmart</a> remains your best bet basically, at least right now.</p><p>However, folks in the UK have it ever so slightly better with the EE Store continuing its trend of shaving pounds off even the latest gaming gear. Right now, folks can pick up the PS5 Pro for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.ee.co.uk/products/sony-playstation-5-pro-1000046525-HW84.html">£695 at the EE Store</a> which is a whole £4.99 off the MSRP of the console. A small win, but a win nonetheless. However, we have spotted something else for UK shoppers that might be of interest if you're prepared to wait a couple of weeks...</p>

<p>Good morning!

One in particular that's always worth highlighting is the brilliant A95L, and it's 65-inch model just so happens to be at a second lowest-ever price right now in the US and a lowest-ever price in the UK!</p><p>In the US, you can get it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-QD-OLED-inch-BRAVIA-Ultra/dp/B0BYPYRH4F/">$2,898 at Amazon</a> (was $3,499.99) and in the UK you can also head to Amazon and get it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-XR-77A95L-QD-OLED-PlayStation5-Seamless/dp/B0CBN92X1S/">£2,799</a> (was £3,599).</p>

<h2 id="will-the-ps5-pro-be-discounted-over-black-friday-2">Will the PS5 Pro be discounted over Black Friday?</h2>
<p>Among the many adjacent game deals and accessory deals, and even widening PS5 Pro bundle options we're starting to see, one question is more important and critical than others: will the PS5 Pro itself get a price cut over Black Friday?</p><p>First the bad news: I don't think so. Putting on my relentlessly realistic hat, it's just too soon for a proper discount given the Pro only released on November 7. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/gaming-industry/sony-executive-says-ps5-pro-pre-orders-are-performing-slightly-stronger-than-pre-orders-for-the-ps4-pro">PS5 Pro pre-orders doing well in Sony's eyes</a>, there would be no need for Sony to introduce an official price cut.</p><p>Now, the not-so-bad news: the above doesn't stop retailers from doing a bit of price-cutting or value-adding, and we're already seeing some versions of this such as this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/this-is-the-kind-of-ps5-pro-bundle-ive-been-waiting-for-ahead-of-black-friday">UK bundle at Very</a> that sees the seller add disc drive to the PS5 Pro to form a bundle and take a few quid off in the process.</p><p>We're hopeful of the value proposition of the PS5 Pro being increased with deals and bundles like this that throw in accessories, games, and more, over the wider Black Friday period given it's too early for a proper price cut.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-know-turns-out-i-was-actually-wrong-about-a-ps5-pro-discount-2">What do I know? Turns out I was actually wrong about a PS5 Pro discount...</h2>
<p>Looks like I'll immediately have to backtrack on my prediction of no PS5 Pro price cut this Black Friday as UK retailer Argos has already wielded the axe on the PS5 Pro's price tag.</p><p>UK shoppers can now go to that retailer and bag the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4440006"><strong>PS5 Pro for £659.99</strong></a> - a saving of 40 quid!</p><p>Let's hope this is the first of many on both sides of the Atlantic...</p>

<p>Good morning once again, and strap in for another day of Black Friday PS5 Pro deals and updates!</p><p>As a starter, it's worth highlighting that two deals we spotted yesterday are both still live and kicking - so don't miss out on them!</p><p>First, we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/this-is-not-a-drill-the-ps5-pro-has-already-received-a-black-friday-price-cut">PS5 Pro being slashed by 40 quid in the UK at Argos</a>, which is incredibly welcome just a week on from the PS5 Pro's launch.</p><p>Second, for those in the US, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/these-amazon-playstation-discounts-might-be-the-closest-we-get-to-any-black-friday-ps-plus-deals-this-year">Amazon's deal on PS gift cards offering Prime members 10% off</a> is still live too, and is very welcome as a form of Black Friday PS Plus deals.</p>
<p>Here's one for the UK crowd given that it's still incredibly early in the US.</p><p>UK PS5 Pro shoppers can team their new enhanced console with the DualSense Edge for less right now too. You can get it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/PlayStation-9443995-DualSense-Wireless-Controller/dp/B0BJW7XKY2/">£195.75 at Amazon</a> right now (was £209.99).</p><p>It's not got a huge discount on it, but it is the lowest Amazon price since a couple of flashes in October that were fractionally lower - as a result, this is basically Amazon's lowest-ever price on the pad.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to our weekend coverage of the Black Friday PS5 Pro deals. I'm TechRadar Gaming's news writer, Demi, taking over for the weekend.</p><p>I realize Sony just launched its latest mid-generation console, the PlayStation 5 Pro, but if you're not looking to invest in a console with a high price tag, these PS5 deals might be ideal for you.</p><p>One of the best PS5 offers I've found today is the PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition + NBA 2K25 bundle at Walmart.</p><p>The PS5 Slim Digital Edition is a great alternative if you're a digital-only gamer and don't mind the lack of disk drive. This console will also award you with 1TB of storage, so there's plenty of room in your digital library for the best PS5 games, including the bundled NBA 2K25.</p><p>Alternatively, Amazon in the UK is also offering up big savings on a PS5 Slim and PS5 Digital Edition, both of which are now available with a 5% discount.

<p>We've got a UK-focused deal to start us off today, and it's an especially good one if you're looking to save money on digital games or on a PS Plus membership or top-up this month.</p><p>The retailer has currently slashed the prices of its PS Store gift cards by a chunky 15%. Discounts on gift cards like these are the best and closest thing we'll get to Black Friday PS Plus deals this year, they make buying any game a whole lot cheaper. We'd recommend jumping on these now if you want to top up your sub for less, or get one of the latest and best games of the year for, well, 15% less!</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.shopto.net/en/sony-gift-card/"><strong>Save 15% on all PlayStation Store gift cards at ShopTo</strong></a></p>

<p>If you're looking for one of the best racing games from this year to get your teeth into this holiday season, or to get the most out of your PS5 Pro then we have found the deal for you.</p><p>The latest in Codemasters' awesome F1 racing series is a stand-out game on the PS5 Pro, and we can tell you directly why that is. Our hardware writer, Dash, recently got to sit down with it and Codemasters to go hands-on with the game and hear about the tech that makes it so good. Here's what he thinks of the game on PS5 Pro.</p><p>"F1 24 looks absolutely stunning on the PS5 Pro, achieving a lush 60 fps at 8K or a butter-smooth 120 fps at 4K. Ray tracing makes iconic tracks like Monaco and newer additions to the calendar like Las Vegas more life-like than ever, especially when you really crank up the rain and let its reflective surfaces shine. It will be a real treat for sim racers on the platform, but also makes for a fantastic showcase of what the PS5 Pro can achieve when all of the graphics options are pushed to the max."</p><p>This is the game's lowest-ever price too, so the value has never been better.</p><p><strong>F1 24 for PS5: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/F1-24-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CWBZP8VY/">was <del>$69.99</del> now<strong> $34.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p>Good morning once again, fellow Black Friday PS5 Pro deal hunters! I'm back once again to keep this page topped up with the best and latest deals on all things PS5 Pro and PS5 that I can find.</p><p>However, as we move closer to the big day itself, there's a few bits of information and advice worth bearing in mind as committing to deals now can be a bit of a melon scratcher at times.</p><p>Anyway, strap in for some of that aforementioned advice, as well some of the best deals going.</p>
<p>One of the questions we get asked by readers, friends, and family around this time of year - and specifically in the weeks close to Black Friday is : should I buy 'X' now or wait for Black Friday itself?</p><p>The simple answer now, only 10 days from the big day itself is, almost always yes. This is for a couple of reasons. First is that almost all the big retailers will now honour any further price drops on products, refunding you the difference should it drop further of over the sales period. This is an excellent safety net, and if you can confirm its the case for your PS5 console or accessory, then it means you can safely miss the rush, safe in the knowledge you got what you want and won't be out of pocket.</p><p>The second reason is a little more simple and is the fact that many of the prices we'll see now - and particularly from this Friday - will be the Black Friday prices. Period. That's just how retailers roll nowadays with more extended Black Friday price periods rather than really specific deals only on one day.</p><p>As a result, we're pretty confident right now - and especially at the end of this week - that the prices we see will be the Black Friday pricing, plus retailers will be honoring any differences should further drops happen.</p>

Yes, it's a little bit older, but quality endures and this is a super deal.</p><p>Note: you will have to get an HDMI adapter like Astro's own one to make the A50 play nice with the PS5 but this huge price cut massively helps to offset that.</p><p><strong>Astro A50 wireless gaming headset: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/astro-gaming-a50-gen-4-wireless-gaming-headset-for-ps5-ps4-black/6349969.p?skuId=6349969">was <del>$249.99 </del>now <strong>$149.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p>

<p>One of the biggest attractions of the PS5 Pro is that its sizeable 2TB of storage means you'll have no trouble having a whole host of games at your fingertips. However, if you're looking for a way to take multiple PS4 games onto PS5 Pro, or just store them with your regular PS5, then an expandable storage like I've found here is well worth considering.</p><p>The WD Black P40 1TB external hard drive is a perfect device for doing just that, and it's come crashing down to a second lowest-ever price at Amazon right now!

<p>Over at Box, the PS5 Pro remains cut in price by £40.

<p>I'm starting today's deals picks with one of the best prices on the PS5 Pro in the UK, for two reasons.</p><p>First, EE has discounted the PS5 Pro by 40 quid which is very welcome in and of itself, but it's also offering an attractive trade-in offer that could see you bag up to £260 for your old console (a trade-in value that's then boosted by a code emailed to you).</p><p>This would take your cash outlay on a new PS5 Pro down to £399 which is pretty attractive if you were thinking of upgrading this month.</p><p><strong>PS5 Pro</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.ee.co.uk/products/sony-playstation-5-pro-1000046525-HW84.html" target="_blank">was <del>£699.99</del> now <strong>£659.99</strong> <strong>at</strong> <strong>EE</strong></a></p>

<p>If you've got a PS5 Pro recently, or are just looking at investing in more storage for your launch or Slim PS5, then a PS5 SSD deal could be just the ticket for you - and we have exactly that for you right now.</p><p>Currently, the WD Black SN850X SSD is on offer at Amazon thanks to a 31% discount. High-end SSDs tend to be on the expensive side, but this offer will save you some cash while offering a solid and handy 1TB of storage - perfect for a PS4 game library on PS5 Pro, for example.</p><p>The 4TB model is also reduced and is now at its lowest price ever at Amazon.

<p>We're kicking off today with an absolute worldie of a Black Friday PS5 deal. The PSVR 2 has received its first ever massive discount, taking up to 40% off (yes, really!) the VR headset for the sales period. It's available at PlayStation Direct, as well as retailers like Best Buy and Walmart in the US, and Currys, Argos and EE in the UK.</p><p>Furthermore, the PSVR 2 - <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain </em>bundle has dropped to the exact same price at many retailers, including PlayStation Direct! This is the model we'd recommend if you immediately want to pair one of the best PSVR 2 games with your headset at no extra cost. For more information, feel free to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/this-astounding-psvr-2-discount-is-the-white-whale-of-black-friday-ps5-deals-check-it-out-before-its-gone">check out our full post on the deal</a>, which also includes links to alternative retailers.</p><p>We've seen very small discounts for PSVR 2 in the past, but literally nothing worth writing home about. This changes today with Sony's Black Friday PS5 deals. And it could honestly be the last time we see such a substantial discount for the headset which has reportedly struggled to shift units thanks to its typically high price tag. Grab one now before they're gone as it could be your last chance to save big on PSVR 2.</p><p><strong>PSVR 2: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2?clickref=1101lzXnYYCY&emcid=ot-ps-456950">was <del>$549.99</del> now <strong>$349.99 at PS Direct</strong></a></p><p><strong>PSVR 2 - Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle">was <del>$599.99</del> now <strong>$349.99 at PS Direct</strong></a></p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href=""></a>The Black Friday PS5 deals and PS5 Pro discounts (there are genuinely some!) are part of the wider PS5 deals we'll see later this month, and there should be a host of discounts on offer across complementing games and accessories.</p><p>• <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-gb-1176294662635512308-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">See all of today's best deals at Amazon</a></p><p>While the PS5 Pro is brand new and we are still not expecting too much in terms of discounts on the machine itself - especially on the US side we're hopeful of seeing some tempting propositions on accessories and games that are adjacent to it.</p><p>Along with the shavings off the PS5 Pro price in the UK, I'm also quietly hoping for some more value offerings on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5-pro-review">PS5 Pro</a> in terms of bundles: perhaps some listings that include the disc drive and vertical stand at a reduced retail price. This would increase the value proposition and help offer a way into the new console in a more fulsome way - and with it being so hard to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5/where-to-buy-ps5-pro-disc-drive-ps5-stand">buy a PS5 disc drive</a> right now, this would be incredibly welcome.</p><p>Anyway, be it such bundles, discounts on the best enhanced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5/ps5-pro-games-list">PS5 Pro games</a>, or other products that will enhance your PS5 and PS5 Pro experience, we're here to gather up all the best deals as we steamroll our way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-sales">Black Friday</a> next week.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to our coverage of this year's Black Friday PS5 Pro deals and sales. if you've been looking for a place to browse for deals on the new Pro console itself (hopefully) or any of the best enhanced games, or accessories to team with your PS5 Pro then you're in the right place.</p><p>While we're hopeful, but not expectant, of some better value offerings on the Pro itself - perhaps via bundles that include extras like the disc drive - we're definitely going to see price cuts on some top games, as well as a plethora of accessories from TVs to headsets, and from controllers to storage.</p><p>I recently reviewed the PS5 Pro so know a thing or two about it and what it can offer you - and what it needs to be better value - and I've also been a PlayStation and gaming hardware editor and writer for years, covering the PS5 launch and stock shortage, and the PlayStation Portal stock debacle too, to name a couple of examples. Importantly, though, I'm also another PlayStation-head who loves to save money on games and accessories so I know what makes a good PS5 Pro deal and PS5 discount. So sit back, and let's begin.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-black-friday-ps5-pro-deals-will-we-see-6">What kind of Black Friday PS5 Pro deals will we see? </h2>
<p>Particularly given the PS5 Pro is so fresh and brand new, you may be wondering what kind of deals I'm going to be concentrating on here - which is a fair question!</p><p>While I don't necessarily expect to see any discounts on the console itself, I am just a tiny bit hopeful of seeing some better value offerings on it. I'd really love to see some retailers bundle up the disc drive and vertical stand with the Pro and shave some money off the price tag, for example. These kinds of bundles will still be expensive, of course, but might be enough to convince folks to jump in and get everything they need in one hit.</p><p>Adjacent to the console itself, on things like PS5 Pro games, and PS5 Pro accessories, is <em>definitely</em> where we are going to see discounts and deals galore. PlayStation first-party games, and major games of the past couple of years which are Pro enhanced will drop in price , so look out for discounts on the likes of <em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>, the <em>Horizon</em> games, and <em>Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart</em> (and more).</p><p>Then we're <em>definitely</em> going to see discounts on accessories and complementing hardware to the PS5 Pro too. Headsets, controllers, SSDs, racing wheels, TVs, monitors, and everything else will have prices slashed so look out for those - and we'll be highlighting a bunch here - throughout the sales period.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="QgSnzyvroeb9QSSoXcfJBi" name="1730830073.jpg" alt="The PS5 Pro box on a wooden desk in front of a white brick background and next to a potted plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QgSnzyvroeb9QSSoXcfJBi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having said that, the first price I need to tell you about is the best price on the PS5 Pro itself right now.</p><p>In the US, the best price we can find is a mere 99 cents off the listing price of $699.99. It's not really a discount at this point, but getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/PLAYSTATION-PS5-PRO-CONSOLE/11839818124">PS5 Pro for $699 at Walmart</a> remains your best bet basically, at least right now.</p><p>However, folks in the UK have it ever so slightly better with the EE Store continuing its trend of shaving pounds off even the latest gaming gear. Right now, folks can pick up the PS5 Pro for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.ee.co.uk/products/sony-playstation-5-pro-1000046525-HW84.html">£695 at the EE Store</a> which is a whole £4.99 off the MSRP of the console. A small win, but a win nonetheless. However, we have spotted something else for UK shoppers that might be of interest if you're prepared to wait a couple of weeks...</p>

<p>Good morning! We're back at it today and seeing what PS5 Pro deals or PS5 accessory and game deals are appearing as we race toward the big sales day itself.</p><p>And we're starting off big today: if you were eyeing up a big TV upgrade to go with your new PS5 Pro then you may well be looking at Sony's excellent lineup of TVs. One in particular that's always worth highlighting is the brilliant A95L, and it's 65-inch model just so happens to be at a second lowest-ever price right now in the US and a lowest-ever price in the UK!</p><p>In the US, you can get it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-QD-OLED-inch-BRAVIA-Ultra/dp/B0BYPYRH4F/">$2,898 at Amazon</a> (was $3,499.99) and in the UK you can also head to Amazon and get it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-XR-77A95L-QD-OLED-PlayStation5-Seamless/dp/B0CBN92X1S/">£2,799</a> (was £3,599).</p>

<h2 id="will-the-ps5-pro-be-discounted-over-black-friday-6">Will the PS5 Pro be discounted over Black Friday?</h2>
<p>Among the many adjacent game deals and accessory deals, and even widening PS5 Pro bundle options we're starting to see, one question is more important and critical than others: will the PS5 Pro itself get a price cut over Black Friday?</p><p>First the bad news: I don't think so. Putting on my relentlessly realistic hat, it's just too soon for a proper discount given the Pro only released on November 7. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/gaming-industry/sony-executive-says-ps5-pro-pre-orders-are-performing-slightly-stronger-than-pre-orders-for-the-ps4-pro">PS5 Pro pre-orders doing well in Sony's eyes</a>, there would be no need for Sony to introduce an official price cut.</p><p>Now, the not-so-bad news: the above doesn't stop retailers from doing a bit of price-cutting or value-adding, and we're already seeing some versions of this such as this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/this-is-the-kind-of-ps5-pro-bundle-ive-been-waiting-for-ahead-of-black-friday">UK bundle at Very</a> that sees the seller add disc drive to the PS5 Pro to form a bundle and take a few quid off in the process.</p><p>We're hopeful of the value proposition of the PS5 Pro being increased with deals and bundles like this that throw in accessories, games, and more, over the wider Black Friday period given it's too early for a proper price cut.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-know-turns-out-i-was-actually-wrong-about-a-ps5-pro-discount-6">What do I know? Turns out I was actually wrong about a PS5 Pro discount...</h2>
<p>Looks like I'll immediately have to backtrack on my prediction of no PS5 Pro price cut this Black Friday as UK retailer Argos has already wielded the axe on the PS5 Pro's price tag.</p><p>UK shoppers can now go to that retailer and bag the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4440006"><strong>PS5 Pro for £659.99</strong></a> - a saving of 40 quid!</p><p>Let's hope this is the first of many on both sides of the Atlantic...</p>

<p>Here's one for the UK crowd given that it's still incredibly early in the US.</p><p>UK PS5 Pro shoppers can team their new enhanced console with the DualSense Edge for less right now too. You can get it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/PlayStation-9443995-DualSense-Wireless-Controller/dp/B0BJW7XKY2/">£195.75 at Amazon</a> right now (was £209.99).</p><p>It's not got a huge discount on it, but it is the lowest Amazon price since a couple of flashes in October that were fractionally lower - as a result, this is basically Amazon's lowest-ever price on the pad.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to our weekend coverage of the Black Friday PS5 Pro deals. I'm TechRadar Gaming's news writer, Demi, taking over for the weekend.</p><p>I realize Sony just launched its latest mid-generation console, the PlayStation 5 Pro, but if you're not looking to invest in a console with a high price tag, these PS5 deals might be ideal for you.</p><p>One of the best PS5 offers I've found today is the PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition + NBA 2K25 bundle at Walmart.</p><p>The PS5 Slim Digital Edition is a great alternative if you're a digital-only gamer and don't mind the lack of disk drive. This console will also award you with 1TB of storage, so there's plenty of room in your digital library for the best PS5 games, including the bundled NBA 2K25.</p><p>Alternatively, Amazon in the UK is also offering up big savings on a PS5 Slim and PS5 Digital Edition, both of which are now available with a 5% discount. That's up to £21 in savings – not huge, but worth having all the same.</p><p><strong>PS5 Slim Digital Edition</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/PlayStation-5-Digital-Slim-Console/9602603812" target="_blank"><strong>$499 at Walmart</strong></a></p><p><strong>PlayStation 5 Slim</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Playstation-711719577157-PlayStation-Console-Slim/dp/B0CM9VHGY7/" target="_blank">was <del>£479.99</del> now <strong>£458 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>PS5 Digital Edition:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/PlayStation-5-Digital-Console-Slim/dp/B0CM9VKQ5N/?th=1" target="_blank">was <del>£389.99</del> now <strong>£369.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p>Now on to the video games! There are plenty of offers to get your hands on ahead of Black Friday but I've seen some particularly good deals on PS5 Pro-enhanced games across multiple retailers.</p><p>Let's start with <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, a personal favorite, and one of the best action-adventure games on the PS5. This offer has been cut down to below half price, saving you $39 total.</p><p><strong>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Star-Wars-Jedi-Survivor-PlayStation-5/1515791379" target="_blank">was <del>$69.99</del> now <strong>$30 at Walmart</strong></a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/2150257?istCompanyId=a74d8886-5df9-4baa-b776-166b3bf9111c&istFeedId=30f62ea9-9626-4cac-97c8-9ff3921f8558&istItemId=qxllatpmw&istBid=t&&cmpid=GS001&_$ja=tsid:59157%7Cacid:534-693-8244%7Ccid:20291201753%7Cagid:%7Ctid:%7Ccrid:%7Cnw:x%7Crnd:18175865756689495407%7Cdvc:c%7Cadp:%7Cmt:%7Cloc:9046545&utm_source=Google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=20291201753&utm_term=2150257&utm_content=shopping&utm_custom1=&utm_custom2=534-693-8244&GPDP=true&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPs7ILIqkSuPkJZd9ih-BQXyDlbVfrwF_SgNFS9mnfShb6iKEUmQxm4aAhpyEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank"><strong></strong></a></p>

<p>If you're in the UK and looking for something a bit more recent, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>on PS5 is also on offer, despite only having launched earlier this month. It's also PS5 Pro-enhanced and looks fantastic on the new console.</p><p>This deal will save you just over £12, and compared to other online listings, I think this option is an absolute steal if you're looking to sink some hours into one of the best RPGs of 2024.</p><p><strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.very.co.uk/playstation-dragon-age-the-veilguard/1601044131.prd" target="_blank">was <del>£69.99</del> now <strong>£57.95 at Very</strong></a></p>

<p>Still sticking with the PS5 accessories, you may want to forget about Sony's fancy DualSense Edge, because this PS5 "pro" controller is now 25% off at Amazon.</p><p>While a bit more on the expensive side, even with the price cut, I think it's totally worth it for the standout features alone.

<p>We've got a UK-focused deal to start us off today, and it's an especially good one if you're looking to save money on digital games or on a PS Plus membership or top-up this month.</p><p>The retailer has currently slashed the prices of its PS Store gift cards by a chunky 15%. Discounts on gift cards like these are the best and closest thing we'll get to Black Friday PS Plus deals this year, they make buying any game a whole lot cheaper. We'd recommend jumping on these now if you want to top up your sub for less, or get one of the latest and best games of the year for, well, 15% less!</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.shopto.net/en/sony-gift-card/"><strong>Save 15% on all PlayStation Store gift cards at ShopTo</strong></a></p>

<p>If you're looking for one of the best racing games from this year to get your teeth into this holiday season, or to get the most out of your PS5 Pro then we have found the deal for you.</p><p>The latest in Codemasters' awesome F1 racing series is a stand-out game on the PS5 Pro, and we can tell you directly why that is. Our hardware writer, Dash, recently got to sit down with it and Codemasters to go hands-on with the game and hear about the tech that makes it so good. Here's what he thinks of the game on PS5 Pro.</p><p>"F1 24 looks absolutely stunning on the PS5 Pro, achieving a lush 60 fps at 8K or a butter-smooth 120 fps at 4K. Ray tracing makes iconic tracks like Monaco and newer additions to the calendar like Las Vegas more life-like than ever, especially when you really crank up the rain and let its reflective surfaces shine. It will be a real treat for sim racers on the platform, but also makes for a fantastic showcase of what the PS5 Pro can achieve when all of the graphics options are pushed to the max."</p><p>This is the game's lowest-ever price too, so the value has never been better.</p><p><strong>F1 24 for PS5: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/F1-24-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CWBZP8VY/">was <del>$69.99</del> now<strong> $34.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p>There was a cracking deal on the Volcanic Red DualSense last week at Walmart which has sadly sold out but fear not as the same retailer has your back with the next best DualSense deal - on another red colorway too.</p><p>The Cosmic Red controller - a dark, almost burgundy-like, red - is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sony-PS5-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Volcanic-Red/5226693879">$65.98 at Walmart</a>, its lowest price since last Black Friday, and has just under 10 bucks cut from its price tag. While we fully expect DualSense's to go down further in price a little closer to Black Friday itself, this is the best deal if you need or want to buy one right now.</p><p><strong>PS5 DualSense controller (Cosmic Red):</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sony-PS5-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Volcanic-Red/5226693879">was <del>$74.99</del> now <strong>$65.98 at Walmart</strong></a></p>
<p>Good morning once again, fellow Black Friday PS5 Pro deal hunters! I'm back once again to keep this page topped up with the best and latest deals on all things PS5 Pro and PS5 that I can find.</p><p>However, as we move closer to the big day itself, there's a few bits of information and advice worth bearing in mind as committing to deals now can be a bit of a melon scratcher at times.</p><p>Anyway, strap in for some of that aforementioned advice, as well some of the best deals going.</p>
<p>One of the questions we get asked by readers, friends, and family around this time of year - and specifically in the weeks close to Black Friday is : should I buy 'X' now or wait for Black Friday itself?</p><p>The simple answer now, only 10 days from the big day itself is, almost always yes. This is for a couple of reasons. First is that almost all the big retailers will now honour any further price drops on products, refunding you the difference should it drop further of over the sales period. This is an excellent safety net, and if you can confirm its the case for your PS5 console or accessory, then it means you can safely miss the rush, safe in the knowledge you got what you want and won't be out of pocket.</p><p>The second reason is a little more simple and is the fact that many of the prices we'll see now - and particularly from this Friday - will be the Black Friday prices. Period. That's just how retailers roll nowadays with more extended Black Friday price periods rather than really specific deals only on one day.</p><p>As a result, we're pretty confident right now - and especially at the end of this week - that the prices we see will be the Black Friday pricing, plus retailers will be honoring any differences should further drops happen.</p>

<p>I've spotted a great US deal on one of my favorite ever wireless gaming headsets that would be perfect for PS5 and PS5 Pro users!</p><p>The excellent Astro A50 wireless gaming headset is down to what I believe is its lowest-ever price right now at Best Buy and offers a brilliant way of getting premium gaming audio for less this November. Yes, it's a little bit older, but quality endures and this is a super deal.</p><p>Note: you will have to get an HDMI adapter like Astro's own one to make the A50 play nice with the PS5 but this huge price cut massively helps to offset that.</p><p><strong>Astro A50 wireless gaming headset: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/astro-gaming-a50-gen-4-wireless-gaming-headset-for-ps5-ps4-black/6349969.p?skuId=6349969">was <del>$249.99 </del>now <strong>$149.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p>

<p>One of the biggest attractions of the PS5 Pro is that its sizeable 2TB of storage means you'll have no trouble having a whole host of games at your fingertips. However, if you're looking for a way to take multiple PS4 games onto PS5 Pro, or just store them with your regular PS5, then an expandable storage like I've found here is well worth considering.</p><p>The WD Black P40 1TB external hard drive is a perfect device for doing just that, and it's come crashing down to a second lowest-ever price at Amazon right now! Snap it up and sort your storage woes (hopefully) in one fell swoop!</p><p><strong>WD Black P40 1TB: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-1TB-Game-Drive-WDBAWY0010BBK-WESN/dp/B09ZRD38D80/">was <del>$139.99</del> now <strong>$99.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p>This is one for UK shoppers looking to add a premium controller to their PS5 Pro or PS5 setup.</p><p>If you've liked the idea of adding a pro controller to your PS5 setup but have balked at the DualSense Edge's price tag, then the Nacon Revolution 5 Pro controller at its lowest-ever UK price could be just the ticket if you want features like remappable buttons, trigger locks, optional weights and grips, and more.</p><p><strong>Nacon Revolution 5 Pro: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/3375691" target="_blank">was <del>£199.99</del> now <strong>£159.99 at Argos</strong></a></p>
<p>Good morning once again from the Black Friday PS5 Pro deal mines!</p><p>I'm once again here to scour the internet for the best PS5 Pro and PS5 deals to provide you with the best ways to get into PlayStation 5 or augment your setup.</p><p>However, let's remind ourselves of the best PS5 Pro deals currently going, starting in the UK...</p>

<p>Over at Box, the PS5 Pro remains cut in price by £40. It's not a huge discount, but considering the console just launched, it's one of the very best available options in the UK right now if you're looking to go big and save some cash.</p><p><strong>PS5 Pro</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://box.co.uk/p5hehwsny59577-sony-playstation-5-pro-console" target="_blank">was <del>£699.99</del> now <strong>£659.99</strong> <strong>at Box</strong></a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.ee.co.uk/products/sony-playstation-5-pro-1000046525-HW84.html" target="_blank"><strong></strong></a></p>
<p>Away from specific deals, there's an excellent milestone not far away from everyone right now, regardless of region.</p><p>There's only a matter of hours before Amazon's Black Friday Week sale officially starts! It begins at 12.01am on November 21 - tomorrow - so that's the very first minute you can strike and expect a huge wave of deals to come rushing toward us.</p><p>However, it also gives you a week or so to bag what you want and play chicken with prices a bit if you're comfortably doing that.</p><p>Either way, if you're keen to strike early or browse early, make sure your details are up to date, and you can even start adding or wish listing the things you're after to get ahead of the game. Tick tock!</p>

<p>We're kicking off today with an absolute worldie of a Black Friday PS5 deal. The PSVR 2 has received its first ever massive discount, taking up to 40% off (yes, really!) the VR headset for the sales period. It's available at PlayStation Direct, as well as retailers like Best Buy and Walmart in the US, and Currys, Argos and EE in the UK.</p><p>Furthermore, the PSVR 2 - <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain </em>bundle has dropped to the exact same price at many retailers, including PlayStation Direct! This is the model we'd recommend if you immediately want to pair one of the best PSVR 2 games with your headset at no extra cost. For more information, feel free to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/this-astounding-psvr-2-discount-is-the-white-whale-of-black-friday-ps5-deals-check-it-out-before-its-gone">check out our full post on the deal</a>, which also includes links to alternative retailers.</p><p>We've seen very small discounts for PSVR 2 in the past, but literally nothing worth writing home about. This changes today with Sony's Black Friday PS5 deals. And it could honestly be the last time we see such a substantial discount for the headset which has reportedly struggled to shift units thanks to its typically high price tag. Grab one now before they're gone as it could be your last chance to save big on PSVR 2.</p><p><strong>PSVR 2: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2?clickref=1101lzXnYYCY&emcid=ot-ps-456950">was <del>$549.99</del> now <strong>$349.99 at PS Direct</strong></a></p><p><strong>PSVR 2 - Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle">was <del>$599.99</del> now <strong>$349.99 at PS Direct</strong></a></p>

<ul><li><strong>Facebook has removed more than two million accounts from its platform</strong></li><li><strong>The accounts were engaged in so-called "pig butchering" scams</strong></li><li><strong>The majority of the victims were in Asian markets</strong></li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In an effort to crack down on organized crime on its platform, Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta has taken down more than two million scam accounts.</p><p>The company revealed the news in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/cracking-down-organized-crime-scam-centers/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, outlining how the bulk of these accounts were used in so-called “pig butchering” scams.</p><p>Pig butchering is a type of scam in which the scammer “stuffs the pig” and prepares it for “slaughter”. In this context, stuffing the pig means tricking the victim into giving away as much money as possible, for as long as possible, before the scam is revealed and the gig is up.</p>
<h2 id="asia-pacific-hotbed-2">Asia-Pacific hotbed</h2>
<p>Such scams are usually done via social engineering, on platforms such as Facebook. The scammers would create fake accounts of (mostly) young, attractive females, and engage in seemingly benign conversation with potential victims. At some point, the scammers would introduce an amazing investment opportunity or platform which, in reality, is not real and is maintained by the crooks.</p><p>They would invite the victim to “invest” together, in preparation of a new life spent together. The victim would give money through an app, and would be shown that investment growing over time. At this point, however, the money is already gone, and is nothing more than numbers on a screen. The scammer would try to keep the ruse going for as long as possible, getting the victim to spend as much as they can.</p><p>When, at some point, the victim tries to withdraw the money (or realizes something is amiss), they will see that it’s not possible.</p><p>In some cases, the fraudsters would take it a bit further, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-identity-theft-protection" target="_blank">impersonating </a>“tech support” from the “investment platform”, and telling the victim to pay a withdrawal fee, or something similar - a final attempt at extracting as much value from the victim as they can.</p><p>Meta says that the majority of the scam centers were located in Asia-Pacific, particularly Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and more recently, the UAE. The victims, however, are scattered all over the globe. The campaign to crack down on these scams is a joint effort, which included many major cryptocurrency exchanges, tech companies such as OpenAI, and law enforcement organizations.</p><p>"Every day, criminals target people across the world through text messaging, dating apps, social media and email in so-called ‘pig-butchering’ and other schemes that try to con them into scam investments," the company's blog psot noted.</p><p>"We hope that sharing our insights will help inform our industry’s defenses so we can collectively help protect people from criminal scammers."</p>

<p>In an effort to crack down on organized crime on its platform, Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta has taken down more than two million scam accounts.</p><p>The company revealed the news in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/cracking-down-organized-crime-scam-centers/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, outlining how the bulk of these accounts were used in so-called “pig butchering” scams.</p><p>Pig butchering is a type of scam in which the scammer “stuffs the pig” and prepares it for “slaughter”. In this context, stuffing the pig means tricking the victim into giving away as much money as possible, for as long as possible, before the scam is revealed and the gig is up.</p>
<h2 id="asia-pacific-hotbed-6">Asia-Pacific hotbed</h2>
<p>Such scams are usually done via social engineering, on platforms such as Facebook. The scammers would create fake accounts of (mostly) young, attractive females, and engage in seemingly benign conversation with potential victims. At some point, the scammers would introduce an amazing investment opportunity or platform which, in reality, is not real and is maintained by the crooks.</p><p>They would invite the victim to “invest” together, in preparation of a new life spent together. The victim would give money through an app, and would be shown that investment growing over time. At this point, however, the money is already gone, and is nothing more than numbers on a screen. The scammer would try to keep the ruse going for as long as possible, getting the victim to spend as much as they can.</p><p>When, at some point, the victim tries to withdraw the money (or realizes something is amiss), they will see that it’s not possible.</p><p>In some cases, the fraudsters would take it a bit further, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-identity-theft-protection" target="_blank">impersonating </a>“tech support” from the “investment platform”, and telling the victim to pay a withdrawal fee, or something similar - a final attempt at extracting as much value from the victim as they can.</p><p>Meta says that the majority of the scam centers were located in Asia-Pacific, particularly Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and more recently, the UAE. The victims, however, are scattered all over the globe. The campaign to crack down on these scams is a joint effort, which included many major cryptocurrency exchanges, tech companies such as OpenAI, and law enforcement organizations.</p><p>"Every day, criminals target people across the world through text messaging, dating apps, social media and email in so-called ‘pig-butchering’ and other schemes that try to con them into scam investments," the company's blog psot noted.</p><p>"We hope that sharing our insights will help inform our industry’s defenses so we can collectively help protect people from criminal scammers."</p>

<ul><li><strong>Cloudflare says European countries saw “little-to-no observable impact” following cable damage</strong></li><li><strong>BSC East-West Interlink and C-Lion1 cables were damaged recently</strong></li><li><strong>Several redundancy options kept the affected nations online</strong></li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Recent damage to undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea which affected some European countries may not have been as bad first though, after Cloudflare <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/resilient-internet-connectivity-baltic-cable-cuts/" target="_blank">claimed</a> the potential sabotage had “little-to-no observable impact” whatsoever.</p><p>The company credited this to Europe’s robust internet infrastructure, demonstrating a high level of resilience supported by a network of redundancy options to keep the continent connected to the internet.</p><p>Two lines were impacted – the BSC East-West Interlink cable between Lithuania and Sweden, and the C-Lion1 cable linking Finland to Germany.</p>
<h2 id="internet-cable-damage-didn-t-really-affect-us-2">Internet cable damage didn’t really affect us</h2>
<p>Cloudflare used metrics like internet quality, latency and bandwidth in the supposedly affected countries to reveal that networks remained stable.</p><p>The BCS East-West Interlink, damaged on November 17, usually carried around one-third of Lithuania’s internet capacity, however alternate pathways allowed the country to stay connected without major disruptions.</p><p>One day later, the C-Lion1 cable was damaged. Minor fluctuations in internet performance, like a slight change in bandwidth and latency in Finland, were observed, however they were remediated within just hours.</p><p>Although undersea cables are critical to keeping countries connected to the internet, several redundancy options make it extremely difficult to entirely cut off a nation.</p><p>Sweden is connected by more than 20 subsea cables, while Finland and Germany have 10. They also benefit from land-based fiber networks, all of which help keep the countries and their critical infrastructures connected during such outages.</p><p>However, the threat of sabotage to undersea cables remains a key focus for many countries. The Danish Navy recently intercepted a suspected Chinese vessel, highlighting the need to protect these physical connections.</p><p>Earlier in 2024, we reported NATO had revealed plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/nato-plans-to-send-internet-to-space-if-subsea-cables-are-cut">use satellite-based connections to safeguard against undersea cable attacks</a>, while other consumer options like Starlink promise to keep citizens connected.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Cloudflare says European countries saw “little-to-no observable impact” following cable damage</strong></li><li><strong>BSC East-West Interlink and C-Lion1 cables were damaged recently</strong></li><li><strong>Several redundancy options kept the affected nations online</strong></li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Recent damage to undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea which affected some European countries may not have been as bad first though, after Cloudflare <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/resilient-internet-connectivity-baltic-cable-cuts/" target="_blank">claimed</a> the potential sabotage had “little-to-no observable impact” whatsoever.</p><p>The company credited this to Europe’s robust internet infrastructure, demonstrating a high level of resilience supported by a network of redundancy options to keep the continent connected to the internet.</p><p>Two lines were impacted – the BSC East-West Interlink cable between Lithuania and Sweden, and the C-Lion1 cable linking Finland to Germany.</p>
<h2 id="internet-cable-damage-didn-t-really-affect-us-6">Internet cable damage didn’t really affect us</h2>
<p>Cloudflare used metrics like internet quality, latency and bandwidth in the supposedly affected countries to reveal that networks remained stable.</p><p>The BCS East-West Interlink, damaged on November 17, usually carried around one-third of Lithuania’s internet capacity, however alternate pathways allowed the country to stay connected without major disruptions.</p><p>One day later, the C-Lion1 cable was damaged. Minor fluctuations in internet performance, like a slight change in bandwidth and latency in Finland, were observed, however they were remediated within just hours.</p><p>Although undersea cables are critical to keeping countries connected to the internet, several redundancy options make it extremely difficult to entirely cut off a nation.</p><p>Sweden is connected by more than 20 subsea cables, while Finland and Germany have 10. They also benefit from land-based fiber networks, all of which help keep the countries and their critical infrastructures connected during such outages.</p><p>However, the threat of sabotage to undersea cables remains a key focus for many countries. The Danish Navy recently intercepted a suspected Chinese vessel, highlighting the need to protect these physical connections.</p><p>Earlier in 2024, we reported NATO had revealed plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/nato-plans-to-send-internet-to-space-if-subsea-cables-are-cut">use satellite-based connections to safeguard against undersea cable attacks</a>, while other consumer options like Starlink promise to keep citizens connected.</p>

There's a first time for everything, though, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> has decided there's no better time to release not one, not two, not even three, but four (!) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/new-movies">new movies </a>ahead of this weekend (November 23-24). The streaming giant's multi-film offering spans the gamut of genres, too, so you've never had such a broad selection of flicks to choose from.</p><p>If, for whatever reason, you're non-plussed by the Netflix Movie Original quartet that recently launched on the platform, don't sweat it.

<h2 id="spellbound-2">Spellbound</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGQiq1ZuCW8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 22<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 110 minutes <br><strong>Age rating:</strong> PG (US) / PG (UK) <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Rachel Zegler, John Lithgow, Jenifer Lewis, Tituss Burgess, Nathan Lane with Javier Bardem, and Nicole Kidman<br><strong>Director:</strong> Vicky Jenson<br><strong>RT score:</strong> TBC (critics); TBC (audience)</p><p>The latest in a long line of animated fairy tale films, <em>Spellbound</em> stars Zegler as Ellian, the precocious princess of a city called Lumbria who embarks on a quest to save her parents. The catch? An evil spell has turned the pair into monsters and Ellian only has 24 hours (surprise, surprise) to reverse the hex or they'll be monsters forever.</p><p>That synopsis may not sound too enchanting, but there are plenty of reasons to catch this family-friendly flick. Its A-list cast notwithstanding, <em>Spellbound</em> has been helmed by the director of <em>Shrek</em>, i.e. one of the best animated movies of all-time. Boosted further by the addition of iconic composer Alan Menken, plus a story full of heart and rich familial themes, I suspect this film will leave you *ahem* spellbound by the time its end credits roll.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 22<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 115 minutes <br><strong>Age rating:</strong> PG-13 (US) / 12 (UK) <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Thomasin McKenzie, James Norton, and Bill Nighy<br><strong>Director:</strong> Ben Taylor<br><strong>RT score:</strong> 88% (critics); TBC (audience)</p><p>Based on the remarkably true story, <em>Joy</em> tells the tale of the first human to be born using in vitro fertilization (IVF) – a ground-breaking 1970s scientific breakthrough in the UK that made it possible for anyone with fertility problems to have children. McKenzie plays Jean Purdy, a young nurse and embryologist who joins forces with geneticist Robert Edwards (Norton) and surgeon Patrick Steptoe (Nighy) to create the first 'test tube baby', despite the clear skepticism and obstacles that stood in their way.</p><p>A true-to-life medical drama that showcases the wonders of science and human perseverance in the face of adversity, <em>Joy</em> is, well, a joy of a movie.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 22<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 127 minutes <br><strong>Age rating:</strong> PG-13 (US) / 12 (UK) <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Samuel L. Jackson, John David Washington, Ray Fisher, Michael Potts, Erykah Badu, Skylar Aleece Smith, Jerrika Hinton, Gail Bean, with Danielle Deadwyler, and Corey Hawkins<br><strong>Director:</strong> Malcolm Washington<br><strong>RT score:</strong> 90% (critics); TBC (audience)</p><p>Set during the Great Depression, <em>The Piano Lesson</em> – a movie adaptation of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel – is a moving drama that should be in the running for prizes (or, at the very least, nominations) on the 2025 awards circuit.</p><p>Legendary actor Jackson plays Doaker, the uncle of warring siblings Boy (Washington) and Berniece (Deadwyler) who are locked in a stand-off over what to do with their family heirloom: a prize piano. Boy wants to sell it to raise funds for the family, Berniece is desperate to keep hold of it, and Doaker is forced to play mediator-in-chief.</p><p>One of November's new Netflix movies that, per critics, occasionally hits a few bum notes, <em>The Piano Lesson</em> is nevertheless a harrowing and tear-jerking story of sacrifice, racial discrimination, and familial inheritance.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 20<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 87 minutes <br><strong>Age rating:</strong> PG-13 (US) / 12 (UK) <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Britt Robertson, Chad Michael Murray, Marla Sokoloff, Beth Broderick, Michael Gross, Maxwell Caulfield, Hector David Jr., Colt Prattes, and Marc Anthony Samuel<br><strong>Director:</strong> Peter Sullivan<br><strong>RT score:</strong> TBC (critics); TBC (audience)</p><p>The third festive film released by Netflix in 2024, The Merry Gentlemen sees Robertson portray Ashley, a former big-city dancer who stages an all-male, Christmas-themed show to raise funds for her parents' small town performance venue. Murray's Luke is among those who signs up to take the stage in this festive <em>Magic Mike</em>-esque romantic drama.</p><p>It doesn't have an official RT score from general audiences or critics yet, but early reactions suggest this is just another haphazardly assembled Netflix Original whose lights should've been turned off before it was commissioned. Steer clear.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 13<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 132 minutes <br><strong>Age rating:</strong> R (US) / 15 (UK) <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Karla Sofia Gascon, Zoe Saldana, Selena Gomez, Adriana Paz, and Edgar Ramirez among others<br><strong>Director:</strong> Jacques Audiard<br><strong>RT score:</strong> 79% (critics); 77% (audience)</p><p>Billed as a musical thriller, this audacious and ambitious Netflix film claims it redefines genres and audience expectations for what similar movies can be. Based on its positive RT ratings, <em>Emilia Perez</em> appears to have largely succeeded in that endeavor and, honestly, I wouldn't be shocked if it makes a late run on the 2025 awards circuit, especially after it won two gongs at this year's Cannes Film Festival.</p><p>So, what's it about? The story follows four Mexican women as they pursue their own idea of what happiness is, but this isn't an anthology flick along the lines of 20th Century Fox's <em>Kinds of Kindness. </em>Instead, Gascon plays the titular fearsome cartel leader who enlists Rita (Saldana), an underappreciated lawyer, to help her fake her own death so she can live the life she always dreamed of. A bold and swaggering flick that unashamedly shines a spotlight on femininity and trans rights.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 13<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 92 minutes <br><strong>Age rating:</strong> PG-13 (US) / PG (UK) <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Lacey Chabert, Dustin Milligan, Katy Mixon Greer, Lauren Holly, Chrishell Stause, Joe Lo Truglio, and Craig Robinson<br><strong>Director:</strong> Jerry Ciccoritti <br><strong>RT score:</strong> 82% (critics); 57% (audience)</p><p>A romantic drama no doubt inspired, albeit loosely by Raymond Briggs' <em>The Snowman</em>, the festive Netflix flick looks more saccharine than most others (but likely just as forgettable as many of its peers) that the streaming titan has released in recent years. Surprisingly, though, it was a bigger hit among critics and than casual viewers.</p><p>Chabert plays Kathy, a widow whose life has never been the same since her husband passed away two years earlier. But, after building a human-sized snowman (Milligan) who magically comes to life, Kathy finds her icy cold heart being *ahem* melted by said creation. The only problem? At some point he'll melt. Cue the pair enjoying each other's company – not to mention falling for each other – before the festive season's cold snap ends.</p>

Otherwise, I'd recommend giving it a wider berth.</p>

                                <p>It's not often that a raft of new Netflix movies arrive within such close proximity to each other. There's a first time for everything, though, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> has decided there's no better time to release not one, not two, not even three, but four (!) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/new-movies">new movies </a>ahead of this weekend (November 23-24). The streaming giant's multi-film offering spans the gamut of genres, too, so you've never had such a broad selection of flicks to choose from.</p><p>If, for whatever reason, you're non-plussed by the Netflix Movie Original quartet that recently launched on the platform, don't sweat it. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-netflix-movies">best Netflix movies </a>is full of other fantastic recommendations, so you'll definitely find something worth loading up the world's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-tv-streaming-service-cord-cutting-compare">best streaming service</a> for.

<h2 id="spellbound-6">Spellbound</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGQiq1ZuCW8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 22<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 110 minutes <br><strong>Age rating:</strong> PG (US) / PG (UK) <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Rachel Zegler, John Lithgow, Jenifer Lewis, Tituss Burgess, Nathan Lane with Javier Bardem, and Nicole Kidman<br><strong>Director:</strong> Vicky Jenson<br><strong>RT score:</strong> TBC (critics); TBC (audience)</p><p>The latest in a long line of animated fairy tale films, <em>Spellbound</em> stars Zegler as Ellian, the precocious princess of a city called Lumbria who embarks on a quest to save her parents. The catch? An evil spell has turned the pair into monsters and Ellian only has 24 hours (surprise, surprise) to reverse the hex or they'll be monsters forever.</p><p>That synopsis may not sound too enchanting, but there are plenty of reasons to catch this family-friendly flick. Its A-list cast notwithstanding, <em>Spellbound</em> has been helmed by the director of <em>Shrek</em>, i.e. one of the best animated movies of all-time. Boosted further by the addition of iconic composer Alan Menken, plus a story full of heart and rich familial themes, I suspect this film will leave you *ahem* spellbound by the time its end credits roll.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 22<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 115 minutes <br><strong>Age rating:</strong> PG-13 (US) / 12 (UK) <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Thomasin McKenzie, James Norton, and Bill Nighy<br><strong>Director:</strong> Ben Taylor<br><strong>RT score:</strong> 88% (critics); TBC (audience)</p><p>Based on the remarkably true story, <em>Joy</em> tells the tale of the first human to be born using in vitro fertilization (IVF) – a ground-breaking 1970s scientific breakthrough in the UK that made it possible for anyone with fertility problems to have children. McKenzie plays Jean Purdy, a young nurse and embryologist who joins forces with geneticist Robert Edwards (Norton) and surgeon Patrick Steptoe (Nighy) to create the first 'test tube baby', despite the clear skepticism and obstacles that stood in their way.</p><p>A true-to-life medical drama that showcases the wonders of science and human perseverance in the face of adversity, <em>Joy</em> is, well, a joy of a movie.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 22<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 127 minutes <br><strong>Age rating:</strong> PG-13 (US) / 12 (UK) <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Samuel L. Jackson, John David Washington, Ray Fisher, Michael Potts, Erykah Badu, Skylar Aleece Smith, Jerrika Hinton, Gail Bean, with Danielle Deadwyler, and Corey Hawkins<br><strong>Director:</strong> Malcolm Washington<br><strong>RT score:</strong> 90% (critics); TBC (audience)</p><p>Set during the Great Depression, <em>The Piano Lesson</em> – a movie adaptation of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel – is a moving drama that should be in the running for prizes (or, at the very least, nominations) on the 2025 awards circuit.</p><p>Legendary actor Jackson plays Doaker, the uncle of warring siblings Boy (Washington) and Berniece (Deadwyler) who are locked in a stand-off over what to do with their family heirloom: a prize piano. Boy wants to sell it to raise funds for the family, Berniece is desperate to keep hold of it, and Doaker is forced to play mediator-in-chief.</p><p>One of November's new Netflix movies that, per critics, occasionally hits a few bum notes, <em>The Piano Lesson</em> is nevertheless a harrowing and tear-jerking story of sacrifice, racial discrimination, and familial inheritance.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 20<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 87 minutes <br><strong>Age rating:</strong> PG-13 (US) / 12 (UK) <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Britt Robertson, Chad Michael Murray, Marla Sokoloff, Beth Broderick, Michael Gross, Maxwell Caulfield, Hector David Jr., Colt Prattes, and Marc Anthony Samuel<br><strong>Director:</strong> Peter Sullivan<br><strong>RT score:</strong> TBC (critics); TBC (audience)</p><p>The third festive film released by Netflix in 2024, The Merry Gentlemen sees Robertson portray Ashley, a former big-city dancer who stages an all-male, Christmas-themed show to raise funds for her parents' small town performance venue. Murray's Luke is among those who signs up to take the stage in this festive <em>Magic Mike</em>-esque romantic drama.</p><p>It doesn't have an official RT score from general audiences or critics yet, but early reactions suggest this is just another haphazardly assembled Netflix Original whose lights should've been turned off before it was commissioned. Steer clear.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 13<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 132 minutes <br><strong>Age rating:</strong> R (US) / 15 (UK) <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Karla Sofia Gascon, Zoe Saldana, Selena Gomez, Adriana Paz, and Edgar Ramirez among others<br><strong>Director:</strong> Jacques Audiard<br><strong>RT score:</strong> 79% (critics); 77% (audience)</p><p>Billed as a musical thriller, this audacious and ambitious Netflix film claims it redefines genres and audience expectations for what similar movies can be. Based on its positive RT ratings, <em>Emilia Perez</em> appears to have largely succeeded in that endeavor and, honestly, I wouldn't be shocked if it makes a late run on the 2025 awards circuit, especially after it won two gongs at this year's Cannes Film Festival.</p><p>So, what's it about? The story follows four Mexican women as they pursue their own idea of what happiness is, but this isn't an anthology flick along the lines of 20th Century Fox's <em>Kinds of Kindness. </em>Instead, Gascon plays the titular fearsome cartel leader who enlists Rita (Saldana), an underappreciated lawyer, to help her fake her own death so she can live the life she always dreamed of. A bold and swaggering flick that unashamedly shines a spotlight on femininity and trans rights.</p>

Surprisingly, though, it was a bigger hit among critics and than casual viewers.</p><p>Chabert plays Kathy, a widow whose life has never been the same since her husband passed away two years earlier. But, after building a human-sized snowman (Milligan) who magically comes to life, Kathy finds her icy cold heart being *ahem* melted by said creation. The only problem? At some point he'll melt. Cue the pair enjoying each other's company – not to mention falling for each other – before the festive season's cold snap ends.</p>

Otherwise, I'd recommend giving it a wider berth.</p>

<hr>
<p>Millions of phishing emails targeting victims every day use ‘do it yourself’ phishing kits developed by Egypt-based ONNX -  but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/11/21/targeting-the-cybercrime-supply-chain/" target="_blank">Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit</a> has now seriously disrupted this operation, seizing 240 fraudulent websites used to help sell Phishing-as-a-Service (PaaS) kits.</p><p>Phishing poses a real threat to individuals and organizations alike, with successful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/this-dangerous-new-phishing-kit-is-hitting-victims-across-europe" target="_blank">phishing attacks delivering devastating financial and data loss</a>. Cybercriminals have taken this further by developing ‘kits’ to sell to other criminals to help develop widespread phishing campaigns and bypass security measures by intercepting MFA requests.</p><p>The attacks that originate from the ‘do it yourself’ kits represent a significant portion of the tens of millions of phishing attacks Microsoft accounts receive each month. The ONNX operation is one of the top five phish kit providers by email volume in 2024, according to Microsoft’s digital defense reports, so the disruption is significant.</p>
<h2 id="name-and-shame-2">Name and shame</h2>
<p>Microsoft has decided to publicly name the individual behind the storefront, Abanoub Nady (known online as “MRxC0DER”), who has been tied to the operation as far back as 2017, and is well established in the PaaS sphere.</p><p>ONNX offers a tiered subscription service, with basic, professional, and enterprise plans - which are promoted, sold, and configured through Telegram, and they even provide ‘how to’ videos for criminals to properly implement the phishing kits.</p><p>Many of the kits used a technique called ‘quishing’, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cybercrime/quishing-is-the-qr-code-scam-you-need-to-watch-out-for">QR code phishing</a>, which prompts users to scan codes where they are redirected to malicious fake websites to enter personal or payment information.</p><p>“As we’ve said before, no disruption is complete in one action. Effectively combatting cybercrime requires persistence and ongoing vigilance to disrupt new malicious infrastructure,” said Assistant General Counsel, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, Steven Masada.</p><p>“While today’s legal action will substantially hamper the fraudulent ONNX’s operations, other providers will fill the void, and we expect threat actors will adapt their techniques in response.”</p>

<hr>
<p>Millions of phishing emails targeting victims every day use ‘do it yourself’ phishing kits developed by Egypt-based ONNX -  but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/11/21/targeting-the-cybercrime-supply-chain/" target="_blank">Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit</a> has now seriously disrupted this operation, seizing 240 fraudulent websites used to help sell Phishing-as-a-Service (PaaS) kits.</p><p>Phishing poses a real threat to individuals and organizations alike, with successful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/this-dangerous-new-phishing-kit-is-hitting-victims-across-europe" target="_blank">phishing attacks delivering devastating financial and data loss</a>. Cybercriminals have taken this further by developing ‘kits’ to sell to other criminals to help develop widespread phishing campaigns and bypass security measures by intercepting MFA requests.</p><p>The attacks that originate from the ‘do it yourself’ kits represent a significant portion of the tens of millions of phishing attacks Microsoft accounts receive each month. The ONNX operation is one of the top five phish kit providers by email volume in 2024, according to Microsoft’s digital defense reports, so the disruption is significant.</p>
<h2 id="name-and-shame-6">Name and shame</h2>
<p>Microsoft has decided to publicly name the individual behind the storefront, Abanoub Nady (known online as “MRxC0DER”), who has been tied to the operation as far back as 2017, and is well established in the PaaS sphere.</p><p>ONNX offers a tiered subscription service, with basic, professional, and enterprise plans - which are promoted, sold, and configured through Telegram, and they even provide ‘how to’ videos for criminals to properly implement the phishing kits.</p><p>Many of the kits used a technique called ‘quishing’, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cybercrime/quishing-is-the-qr-code-scam-you-need-to-watch-out-for">QR code phishing</a>, which prompts users to scan codes where they are redirected to malicious fake websites to enter personal or payment information.</p><p>“As we’ve said before, no disruption is complete in one action. Effectively combatting cybercrime requires persistence and ongoing vigilance to disrupt new malicious infrastructure,” said Assistant General Counsel, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, Steven Masada.</p><p>“While today’s legal action will substantially hamper the fraudulent ONNX’s operations, other providers will fill the void, and we expect threat actors will adapt their techniques in response.”</p>

<p>Chinese hackers have built new all-in-one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-malware-removal" target="_blank">malware</a> to target Linux devices, a new report from cybersecurity researchers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/unveiling-wolfsbane-gelsemiums-linux-counterpart-to-gelsevirine/#Technical%20analysis" target="_blank">ESET</a>, have said.</p><p>The WolfsBane malware features a dropper, launcher, a backdoor, and a modified open-source rootkit for detection evasion.

It can execute commands coming in from the C2 server, exfiltrate data, and ultimately - manipulate the system.</p>
<h2 id="gelsemium-is-active-2">Gelsemium is active</h2>
<p>ESET doesn’t know for certain how the attackers accessed the target systems to deploy the malware in the first place, but assesses “with medium confidence” that the group exploited an unknown web application vulnerability.</p><p>The group, in this instance, is called Gelsemium, suggesting that it has at least one herbalist in its ranks. Itis a relatively known Chinese group, active since at least 2014. It mostly targets government institutions, educational organizations, electronics manufacturers, and religious institutions. The majority of its victims are located in East Asia and the Middle Easts.</p><p>ESET also suggests that the group decided to target <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-linux-distros" target="_blank">Linux</a> since Windows’ defenses have been getting better lately.</p><p>"The trend of APT groups focusing on Linux malware is becoming more noticeable,” ESET said.</p><p>“We believe this shift is due to improvements in Windows email and endpoint security, such as the widespread use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-endpoint-security-software" target="_blank">endpoint detection and response </a>(EDR) tools and Microsoft's decision to disable Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros by default. Consequently, threat actors are exploring new attack avenues, with a growing focus on exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems, most of which run on Linux."</p><p><em>Via </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-gelsemium-hackers-use-new-wolfsbane-linux-malware/" target="_blank"><em>BleepingComputer</em></a></p>

<p>ESET doesn’t know for certain how the attackers accessed the target systems to deploy the malware in the first place, but assesses “with medium confidence” that the group exploited an unknown web application vulnerability.</p><p>The group, in this instance, is called Gelsemium, suggesting that it has at least one herbalist in its ranks. Itis a relatively known Chinese group, active since at least 2014. It mostly targets government institutions, educational organizations, electronics manufacturers, and religious institutions.

He explains how to find your way through the AI hype to the four areas where AI will bring contact centers and employees most value.</p><p>A recent Deloitte study “2024 Global Contact Center Survey” finds that service innovators are over performing  and setting a new  gold standard – 1.6x in meeting strategic goals, 4.6x in improving customer satisfaction and 2.5x in employee satisfaction. The report identifies service innovators as those that invest in the use of AI and analytics as key drivers.</p><p>Using AI in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-call-center-software">contact center</a> can contribute massively to quality management and take away the laborious activities associated with quality management when reviewed by a human For example, AI can track whether the call went according to all rules, regulations, and company policies, it can monitor whether the tone of voice was correct, and it can determine if customer details, financial or not, have been stored correctly and safely. It can of course do all this at a much quicker rate than humans, and aids the better management of day-to-day operations.</p><p>But there’s even more potential to leverage AI - aggregating and analyzing key contact center data points – then integrating these insights into a real-time dashboard to automatically alert contact center supervisors of any exceptional activity. The potential goes on.</p>
<p>So you need to get on to the AI bus, but how do you find your way through the AI hype?</p><p>There are four key areas where AI is seriously improving customer contact enablement in the contact center:</p>
<h2 id="1-text-channels-with-an-ai-boost-keep-flexibility-at-the-core-2">1. Text channels with an AI boost keep flexibility at the core </h2>
<p>Regardless of the number of agents operating in a contact center, AI can be a useful tool in the condensing and analysis of large amounts of data. If you think AI will be used to replace humans, read on. New research suggests that 70% of contact center managers believe AI will mean there will be more agents in the next 10 years, not fewer – and their roles are likely to evolve. Here’s how.</p><p>The use and need of AI can vary from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-business-plan-software">business</a> to business, so it’s important that a comprehensive contact center solution keeps flexibility at the heart of operations. Integrating AI into text channels, i.e., emails, SMS, web chat, and other social channels needs varying levels of flexibility. For example, does a customer wish to use AI-assist for email enquiries? Or would they simply prefer an automated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-email-provider">email</a> process?</p><p>AI is capable of answering simple questions. A customer query into business opening times would not warrant a human agent response, in fact, it would simply be a waste of agent time and resources. Instead, AI could answer this quickly and efficiently, leaving human agents to deal with more complex enquiries</p><p>But the human element remains. The age of personalization is not dead, and its with these more complex queries that human interaction still has a strong hold over the customer journey. Here, AI uses customer data to inform next actions dependent on the individual customer. It can route customer queries to the right person, and provide assistance for these requests – think suggested responses, summarized data, previous call history.</p><p>It all contributes to a better <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/cx-tools">customer experience</a> and employee experience. When agents are better equipped to deal with these queries, they are empowered, their efficiency is increased, and confidence and trust is instilled and builds for both customers and employees.</p><p>…and it speaks any language!</p><p>Transcription and translation services within AI make global communication easier. Even if the agent and the customer are speaking different languages, AI integrated into these text channels can help them communicate in a preferred language. The benefits are clear to see, particularly for countries with multiple languages - Belgium, as an example, has four languages!</p>
<h2 id="2-the-ears-and-eyes-of-the-contact-center-ai-call-routing-improves-cx-and-ex-2">2. The ears and eyes of the contact center: AI call routing improves CX and EX </h2>
<p>Directing a customer query to the right place and person might sound like standard practice, but it’s a critical element of a great customer journey. Customers always demand a quick and easy resolution. It’s where a comprehensive recording helps. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-call-recorder-software">Call recording</a> is not new, but the process can be made even better with the use of AI. AI will listen to the call in progress and provide summaries to the agent, and suggestive answers. It’s there to help employees and ensure they have correct tools, answers, and data to be efficient.</p><p>Using AI, the purpose of the call can be quickly analyzed. Whether it’s to ensure that previous correspondence is considered – perhaps a customer sent an email a while back, this will be added to their record – or that the reason for call is directed to the right department in the contact center. It’s important that the right agent has the means to deal with the query on the end of the call.</p><p>It’s not what you say, it’s the way that you say it.</p><p>Going a step further, AI also provides semantic recognition to monitor the tone of the call – it examines the conversation for specific words or the general sentiment or mood of the customer, such as whether they’re slightly angry, very disappointed or even laughing, for example. Sentiment analysis is used by the system to proactively analyze cases and provide agents with suggestions for how to resolve issues quickly and effectively, to ensure the customer journey is pleasant right the way through. It all aids better, more effective training.</p><p>Not only this, sentiment analysis can also send alerts directly to a supervisor for the chance to intervene or be used in future training exercises to improve employee workflows. It can work across screens, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-social-media-management-tools">social media</a>, and webchat, in fact, it will operate on whatever channel agents and customers are using, to support additional training and an agent’s ability to solve the issue.</p>
<h2 id="3-historical-and-real-time-reporting-knowledge-of-the-past-enables-you-to-deal-with-the-future-2">3. Historical and real-time reporting: Knowledge of the past enables you to deal with the future</h2>
<p>Reporting provides visibility into processes and events that might not be visible on quick inspection – something that is especially important in the virtual contact center where service and operations are spread out over remote locations.</p><p>When it comes to day-to-day operations, reporting within the contact center can be hugely beneficial when integrated with the use of AI in three particular areas: wasted time is reduced by ensuring human agents are focused on the jobs that matter most, human agents and distractions are monitored and assessed on how to be minimized, and the length of calls and busy peak times are reduced, as contact centers can ensure they have enough staff on during busy periods, with a focus on how calls can be more efficient.</p><p>In order to maximize the value in their data, contact centers need two types of reporting: Historical reporting and Real-time insights. Both are vital to laser in on key pain points in the customer journey and address them with precision.</p>
<h2 id="4-a-safe-place-keeping-data-secure-with-microsoft-azure-ai-2">4. A safe place: Keeping data secure with Microsoft Azure AI</h2>
<p>After all this, the importance of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-security-key">security</a> can’t go unnoticed. Gen-AI requires access to a large data set, and in a contact center setting this can be personal customer data that must be kept safe. If you’re storing customer data, then it’s a given that you need a secure technology stack that keeps this information private.</p><p>For example, a solution natively integrated with Microsoft Teams means the entire tech stack, including AI models, is Microsoft based. Therefore, all data is stored in Azure Open AI, and therefore all data is always kept in the tenant customer. Risk and safety monitoring, safety evaluations, prompt shields, safety system messages are just a handful of the new features coming to Microsoft Azure AI to help keep businesses safe. Take a cyberattack as an example. If a cyberattack meets certain criteria defined by the security team, AI can automate the response and isolate the affected assets. Generative AI takes this one step further by producing original natural language text, images, and other content based on patterns in existing data.</p><p>Keeping customers secure is a top priority for Microsoft, which is why the company invests $1 billion every year into security, which includes protecting the Azure infrastructure. It also employs 3,500 cybersecurity experts, including 200 who continually look for weaknesses. When it comes to how the technology works, data sent within the Azure environment is automatically encrypted by AI. Then, automated smart traffic monitoring and profiling makes it easier to detect and deflect threats as the system knows when something looks out of the ordinary.</p>
<h2 id="the-triple-boost-from-ai-enhancing-ex-cx-and-contact-center-operations-2">The triple boost from AI: enhancing EX, CX, and contact center operations!</h2>
<p>The power of AI when used correctly in the contact center can be felt along the entire contact center chain. It begins with well-trained, empowered employees that are equipped with the tools and data to perform at an exceedingly high level. They are able to answer customer queries quickly, and correctly, in whatever language the customer speaks!</p><p>Contact center operations are optimized, whether it be for the length of calls and monitoring for peak times, contact centers can use AI to reduce wait times and ensure more staff are working in busy periods. Effective reporting software gives employees access to historical information and real-time insights to assess the severity of queries. Not to mention that all their data and personal information is kept safe!</p><p>And finally, it all contributes to a better customer experience – whether it be a quick resolution, first time fixes, short wait times, or a call directed to the correct department – it all falls under the CX umbrella.</p><p>Remember, AI does the jobs better that are too time consuming for humans to do, leaving humans to do the jobs that they are good at better – customer service.</p>

Then, automated smart traffic monitoring and profiling makes it easier to detect and deflect threats as the system knows when something looks out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>The power of AI when used correctly in the contact center can be felt along the entire contact center chain. It begins with well-trained, empowered employees that are equipped with the tools and data to perform at an exceedingly high level. They are able to answer customer queries quickly, and correctly, in whatever language the customer speaks!</p><p>Contact center operations are optimized, whether it be for the length of calls and monitoring for peak times, contact centers can use AI to reduce wait times and ensure more staff are working in busy periods. Effective reporting software gives employees access to historical information and real-time insights to assess the severity of queries. Not to mention that all their data and personal information is kept safe!</p><p>And finally, it all contributes to a better customer experience – whether it be a quick resolution, first time fixes, short wait times, or a call directed to the correct department – it all falls under the CX umbrella.</p><p>Remember, AI does the jobs better that are too time consuming for humans to do, leaving humans to do the jobs that they are good at better – customer service.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Like many of you, I’ve had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-business-smartphone">phone</a> calls from scammers. They’re usually very easy to spot, even before I pick up the phone – invariably they are from an unknown mobile number, something a legitimate organization would never use. The caller then goes on to explain that they are calling from my phone provider – clearly a list of phone numbers associated with particular phone companies has been leaked at some point.</p><p>Despite their sophistication, I can get these scammers to hang up with five simple words: “who are you calling for?” They may have my number, but they don’t have my name or indeed any other personal details, so asking them who they are calling for, and repeating the question when they inevitably try to evade it, always causes them to hang up in a panic. I could, of course, end the call myself, or not take the call, but there is a small degree of satisfaction in letting criminals who exploit the most vulnerable people in our society know that they can be undone in only five words.</p><p>While typical scams can be easy to thwart, new fraud tactics are emerging every day and can fool the wariest of consumers. Even people who are well-informed can fall for what seem to outsiders to be pretty obvious scams all the time: you may recall a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-personal-finance-software">finance</a> advice columnist being persuaded to hand over $50,000 dollars in cash in a shoe box to a scam caller claiming to be from the CIA. The demographic most likely to fall for scams isn’t the elderly, but digital natives under 25s.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-app-fraud-so-prevalent-2">Why is APP Fraud so prevalent?</h2>
<p>The most common form of fraud by far is authorized push payment (APP) fraud. The definition is simple, but the ways in which it can be carried out are widely varied: at its most basic level, APP fraud is any fraud that makes use of the APP technology. Those of you who use banking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-money-transfer-apps">apps</a> will be familiar with the ability to send payments to friends or businesses through the app, and the multiple layers of warnings that you may be sending money to a scammer. You can also send push payments by calling a bank’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/the-best-customer-database-software-of-year">customer</a> service line or in a branch, though these are less common, and fraudsters will try to steer you away from these solutions since bank employees are trained to look for evidence of scams.</p><p>The scale of the problem is staggering. In 2023 alone, £1.17 billion was stolen through various forms of fraud, and while APP losses decreased by 5%, the total number of APP cases rose by 12%​. Despite major efforts by banks to mitigate these losses—deploying increasingly sophisticated technology, partnering with law enforcement, and rolling out public awareness campaigns—criminals continue to evolve. In fact, 76% of APP fraud originated online, with an additional 16% coming from telecommunications​.</p><p>While financial institutions bear the brunt of combatting fraud through proactive measures, consumers are still being tricked into sending money to fraudsters. Even with layers of alerts, prompts, and security measures, scams continue to succeed, primarily because through generative <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ai-tools">AI</a> and machine-learning tools, criminals have become expert manipulators. They exploit consumers' trust in legitimate platforms, making it harder to detect fraud until it's too late.</p>
<h2 id="the-hard-truth-about-app-fraud-2">The hard truth about APP Fraud </h2>
<p>So, what is the missing link? The answer is, unfortunately, consumers. No amount of regulation, no reimbursement policy, or sophisticated technology can fully replace the vigilance and awareness required at the consumer level. Banks can prevent unauthorized fraud—where payments are made without a customer’s consent—more effectively than APP fraud, where the customer themselves authorizes the transaction, albeit under false pretenses. In unauthorized fraud cases, banks are able to recover or prevent the loss of money in 64% of incidents​. APP fraud, by contrast, often sees a much lower rate of recovery, as criminals are adept at moving money quickly once they’ve gained access to an account.</p><p>APP scams often involve highly believable social engineering techniques. Fraudsters impersonate legitimate organizations such as banks, government departments, or even utility companies. In other instances, they exploit emotional vulnerabilities, like in romance scams, where victims are convinced they’re in a genuine relationship. These types of fraud play out over long periods of time, sometimes involving up to ten separate payments per case​. With such a personal touch, it’s easy to see how these scams bypass even the most robust <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-internet-security-suites">security</a> measures.</p><p>The financial industry has certainly stepped up, but the hard truth remains: criminals will always adapt to the latest technological advancements, meaning the fraud landscape will continue to evolve. The focus, therefore, must also shift towards empowering consumers with the skills they need to recognize fraud before it happens.</p><p>Consider the generational gap in fraud susceptibility. You might expect older adults, who are often seen as less tech-savvy, to be most at risk. Yet under-25s are statistically more likely to fall victim to online scams. This isn’t due to a lack of familiarity with technology; quite the opposite. Young adults, comfortable with digital environments, tend to be more trusting of online interactions​. They are also the demographic most likely to engage in behaviors that make them vulnerable to fraud, such as using insecure platforms for transactions or being lured by ‘too good to be true’ deals on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-social-media-management-tools">social media</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fighting-app-fraud-starts-with-consumers-2">Fighting APP fraud starts with consumers </h2>

                            <article>
                                <p>Like many of you, I’ve had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-business-smartphone">phone</a> calls from scammers. They’re usually very easy to spot, even before I pick up the phone – invariably they are from an unknown mobile number, something a legitimate organization would never use. The caller then goes on to explain that they are calling from my phone provider – clearly a list of phone numbers associated with particular phone companies has been leaked at some point.</p><p>Despite their sophistication, I can get these scammers to hang up with five simple words: “who are you calling for?” They may have my number, but they don’t have my name or indeed any other personal details, so asking them who they are calling for, and repeating the question when they inevitably try to evade it, always causes them to hang up in a panic. I could, of course, end the call myself, or not take the call, but there is a small degree of satisfaction in letting criminals who exploit the most vulnerable people in our society know that they can be undone in only five words.</p><p>While typical scams can be easy to thwart, new fraud tactics are emerging every day and can fool the wariest of consumers. Even people who are well-informed can fall for what seem to outsiders to be pretty obvious scams all the time: you may recall a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-personal-finance-software">finance</a> advice columnist being persuaded to hand over $50,000 dollars in cash in a shoe box to a scam caller claiming to be from the CIA. The demographic most likely to fall for scams isn’t the elderly, but digital natives under 25s.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-app-fraud-so-prevalent-6">Why is APP Fraud so prevalent?</h2>
<p>The most common form of fraud by far is authorized push payment (APP) fraud. The definition is simple, but the ways in which it can be carried out are widely varied: at its most basic level, APP fraud is any fraud that makes use of the APP technology. Those of you who use banking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-money-transfer-apps">apps</a> will be familiar with the ability to send payments to friends or businesses through the app, and the multiple layers of warnings that you may be sending money to a scammer. You can also send push payments by calling a bank’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/the-best-customer-database-software-of-year">customer</a> service line or in a branch, though these are less common, and fraudsters will try to steer you away from these solutions since bank employees are trained to look for evidence of scams.</p><p>The scale of the problem is staggering. In 2023 alone, £1.17 billion was stolen through various forms of fraud, and while APP losses decreased by 5%, the total number of APP cases rose by 12%​. Despite major efforts by banks to mitigate these losses—deploying increasingly sophisticated technology, partnering with law enforcement, and rolling out public awareness campaigns—criminals continue to evolve. In fact, 76% of APP fraud originated online, with an additional 16% coming from telecommunications​.</p><p>While financial institutions bear the brunt of combatting fraud through proactive measures, consumers are still being tricked into sending money to fraudsters. Even with layers of alerts, prompts, and security measures, scams continue to succeed, primarily because through generative <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ai-tools">AI</a> and machine-learning tools, criminals have become expert manipulators. They exploit consumers' trust in legitimate platforms, making it harder to detect fraud until it's too late.</p>
<h2 id="the-hard-truth-about-app-fraud-6">The hard truth about APP Fraud </h2>
<p>So, what is the missing link? The answer is, unfortunately, consumers. No amount of regulation, no reimbursement policy, or sophisticated technology can fully replace the vigilance and awareness required at the consumer level. Banks can prevent unauthorized fraud—where payments are made without a customer’s consent—more effectively than APP fraud, where the customer themselves authorizes the transaction, albeit under false pretenses. In unauthorized fraud cases, banks are able to recover or prevent the loss of money in 64% of incidents​. APP fraud, by contrast, often sees a much lower rate of recovery, as criminals are adept at moving money quickly once they’ve gained access to an account.</p><p>APP scams often involve highly believable social engineering techniques. Fraudsters impersonate legitimate organizations such as banks, government departments, or even utility companies. In other instances, they exploit emotional vulnerabilities, like in romance scams, where victims are convinced they’re in a genuine relationship. These types of fraud play out over long periods of time, sometimes involving up to ten separate payments per case​. With such a personal touch, it’s easy to see how these scams bypass even the most robust <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-internet-security-suites">security</a> measures.</p><p>The financial industry has certainly stepped up, but the hard truth remains: criminals will always adapt to the latest technological advancements, meaning the fraud landscape will continue to evolve. The focus, therefore, must also shift towards empowering consumers with the skills they need to recognize fraud before it happens.</p><p>Consider the generational gap in fraud susceptibility. You might expect older adults, who are often seen as less tech-savvy, to be most at risk. Yet under-25s are statistically more likely to fall victim to online scams. This isn’t due to a lack of familiarity with technology; quite the opposite. Young adults, comfortable with digital environments, tend to be more trusting of online interactions​. They are also the demographic most likely to engage in behaviors that make them vulnerable to fraud, such as using insecure platforms for transactions or being lured by ‘too good to be true’ deals on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-social-media-management-tools">social media</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fighting-app-fraud-starts-with-consumers-6">Fighting APP fraud starts with consumers </h2>
<p>To truly combat APP fraud, consumers need to develop a healthy level of scepticism when it comes to their digital interactions. Trusting that a bank’s warnings or anti-fraud systems will always intervene is misguided.

<p>When it comes to '90s teen dramas, <em>Cruel Intentions </em>was one of the biggest movies of the time. Its story of bored, scheming step siblings (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe) at an elite school who try to seduce a new student (Reese Witherspoon) as part of a twisted bet is not something you'd expect to be remade into a TV show nowadays, but Amazon has done exactly that.</p><p>Not many were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/amazon-prime-video/prime-video-releases-new-trailer-for-its-cruel-intentions-tv-remake-and-first-images-for-the-rig-season-2-but-im-not-thrilled-by-either-of-them">thrilled by the idea of a <em>Cruel Intentions </em>TV remake</a>, so it's probably not surprising that the new series has a Rotten Tomatoes score of just 22% since it landed on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/amazon-prime-video">Prime Video</a>. While it won't make the cut for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-amazon-prime-shows">best Prime Video shows</a>, the original movie is available for free on Amazon Freevee in the US, plus Prime Video in the UK and Australia.

<p>There's always a great deal of intrigue when a new true crime documentary airs. Recently, Netflix has led the charge with movies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/woman-of-the-hour-is-the-scariest-movie-ive-seen-in-2024-so-far-and-its-not-even-a-horror"><em>Woman of the Hour</em></a><em> </em>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/netflixs-3-most-watched-tv-show-ever-is-returning-soon-with-a-new-spine-chilling-installment-in-the-monster-anthology-series">the latest in Ryan Murphy's <em>Monsters </em>franchise</a>. If you're in the mood for something similar, then, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Peacock</a> is bringing us up close and personal to one of America's most notorious killers: Charles Manson.</p><p>This docuseries is described as "offering unfiltered insights into America's most notorious killer, Charles Manson. Through 20 years' worth of never-before-aired conversations, those closest to the case have their views challenged". So, it should be a very interesting watch, featuring clips of the man himself and those who knew him. If you prefer your crime fictionalized, though, I highly recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/peacock-horror-series-hysteria-gets-its-first-full-trailer-and-i-m-obsessed-with-the-evil-dead-references">Peacock's horror series <em>Hysteria!</em></a>.</p><p><em>Lucy Buglass, senior entertainment writer</em></p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techradar.com/tag/alien-romulus"><em>Alien: Romulus</em></a><em> </em>has made its official streaming debut! Well, on Hulu, anyway – if you were too scared to see it in the theater, then, not to worry, because in your living room no one can hear you scream from behind your cushion.

<p>Have you got your tissues handy?

Before you stream them, read my<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href=""><em>Arcane</em> season 2 act 2 ending explained</a> piece to remind yourself what happened last time out.

<p>One of November's many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/new-netflix-movies">new Netflix movies</a> <em>Spellbound</em> follows Princess Ellian (Rachel Zegler), the young princes of Lumbria who goes on a quest to save her family after a spell transforms her parents into monsters.</p><p>Ahead of my press<em> </em>screening (keep an eye out for my full review this weekend), I was expecting it to be your average children's animated fantasy. However, I left feeling surprisingly emotional at the film's moving message that many families will appreciate. Indeed, Spellbound, which may have enough about it to join our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-netflix-movies">best Netflix movies, </a>is a heart-warming and magical adventure set in a vivid world that's perfect for all the family.

<p>When it comes to '90s teen dramas, <em>Cruel Intentions </em>was one of the biggest movies of the time. Its story of bored, scheming step siblings (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe) at an elite school who try to seduce a new student (Reese Witherspoon) as part of a twisted bet is not something you'd expect to be remade into a TV show nowadays, but Amazon has done exactly that.</p><p>Not many were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/amazon-prime-video/prime-video-releases-new-trailer-for-its-cruel-intentions-tv-remake-and-first-images-for-the-rig-season-2-but-im-not-thrilled-by-either-of-them">thrilled by the idea of a <em>Cruel Intentions </em>TV remake</a>, so it's probably not surprising that the new series has a Rotten Tomatoes score of just 22% since it landed on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/amazon-prime-video">Prime Video</a>. While it won't make the cut for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-amazon-prime-shows">best Prime Video shows</a>, the original movie is available for free on Amazon Freevee in the US, plus Prime Video in the UK and Australia.
