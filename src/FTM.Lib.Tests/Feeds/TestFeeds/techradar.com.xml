<hr>
<p>Today's Wordle answer (game #1294) is… <strong>CHEAP</strong>.</p><p>The problem with playing a random start word each day is that there's no leveling out of the vagaries of fate. If you begin with CRANE, or SLATE, or STARE, there will be good days and bad – and you'll experience them all. But because these are among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/wordle-best-starting-word">best Wordle starting words</a>, they will necessarily serve up more of the good and fewer of the bad.</p><p>However, when you take the random route those probabilities don't apply. A word like BURST – my starter today – is actually a good choice, one that WordleBot rates as 89 out of 99. That's way above the score for ADIEU or AUDIO, for instance. But the problem is that if the day on which I play it doesn't happen to be one of the days when it's helpful, that's that. Done. There's no element of 'Never mind, it'll probably come good tomorrow'.</p><p>BURST <em>should</em> have performed well – it contains three of the most common letters in the game, plus a vowel, and the third most likely starting letter. Unfortunately, it was spectacularly unlucky (10/99 for luck, WordleBot said) today and drew a blank.</p><p>That meant I started the second guess with 750 possible answers, whereas the 'bot had only 13 thanks to CRANE doing well today, and anyone who played CRATE (12), CARET (7) or CARTE (2) will have been happier still.</p><p>CHEAP should not really have been a 4/6 answer; it has a global average of only 3.3, making it even easier than yesterday's CHOSE (3.4). Like that solution, it begins with the very common CH combination, but whereas yesterday you might have been confused by WHOSE or THOSE, CHEAP doesn't have any really similar alternative words to contend with. It's a really simple Wordle to solve.</p><p>However, my cards were marked after that first guess, and though I scored 99/99 for skill on each of the next three attempts, I couldn't beat the standard score.</p><p>Still, things will be better tomorrow, right? Right?</p><p>How did you do today? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="mailto:marc.mclaren@futurenet.com" target="_blank">Send me an email </a>and let me know.</p>

<p>In a different time zone where it's still Thursday? Don't worry – I can give you some clues for Wordle #1293, too.</p>
<ul><li>Wordle yesterday <strong>had vowels in two places</strong>.</li></ul>
<p><em>* Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too). </em></p>
<ul><li>The first letter in yesterday's Wordle answer was <strong>C</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>C is a very common starting letter in Wordle – in fact, it's the second most common of all, behind only S.</p>
<ul><li>There were <strong>no repeated letters</strong> in yesterday's Wordle.</li></ul>
<p>Repeated letters are quite common in the game, with 748 of the 2,309 Wordle answers containing one. However, it's still more likely that a Wordle <em>doesn't</em> have one.</p>
<ul><li>The last letter in yesterday's Wordle was <strong>E</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>E is the most common letter to end a Wordle answer by far. That's one of the reasons why many of the best start words, including SLATE, CRANE, CRATE and STARE, all end with one.</p>

<p><em>* From WordleBot's Top 20 start words</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Yesterday's Wordle answer (game #1293) was… <strong>CHOSE</strong>.</p><p>This one is all about combinations. But then again, aren't most Wordles? Knowing which letters go together is part of the deal here; if you uncover a green S at the start of a word, you immediately know it's probably going to be followed by a T, H or P, with a few other combos further down the list. If you get an H at the end, in all likelihood it's going to be preceded by an S or T.</p><p>CHOSE has very common combinations at both the start and end. At the front of the word you have CH – which is the fifth most common opening pairing after ST, SH, CR and SP. There are 40 CH words among the original 2,309 solutions, so it's always one to look out for.</p><p>At the end, meanwhile, you have SE. This might seem a lot less common; after all, S always goes at the start, right? But it's actually the third most likely letter to appear in that fourth slot, too, and when it does it's regularly followed by an E. The SE ending combination occurs 52 times, putting it fourth after ER (141), LY (56) and CH (also 56).</p><p>Of course whether you stumbled across those patterns or actively looked for them will have depended to an extent on your choice of start word. If you played CRANE, as WordleBot does, you'll have had the first and last letters in place, giving you good hints about what to add next. CRANE left only 14 answers anyway – so a score of 3/6 was on the cards here. That probably explains the super-low global average of 3.4.</p><p>If, however, you began with LUMPY as I did (let's face it – nobody else played <em>that</em>) then you'll have had no information at all beyond the fact that none of those letters were included.</p><p>I still had more than 1,000 words available to me, so did the simple thing and played my ideal start word as my second: STARE. I knew this wouldn't be right after its appearance as an answer a few days ago, but it gave me a green E at the end, and a yellow S, and cut my answers to nine.</p><p>At this point I was greedy, and nearly suffered for it later. I had found seven of the nine words – CHOSE, WHOSE, NOISE, GOOSE, GEESE, NOOSE and DENSE – and should really have guaranteed myself a four by playing another narrowing-down word; WordleBot suggested CROWN.</p><p>Instead, I took a shot at the answer and went with NOISE. This was <em>not</em> guaranteed to give me the solution, in that it could have left a three-way choice between CHOSE, WHOSE and OBESE (the latter of which was one of the two words I hadn't found, along with DOWSE). And inevitably, that's the scenario that played out, with the SE combination turning green and O going yellow.</p><p>I couldn't recall either CHOSE or WHOSE being a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/past-wordle-answers">past Wordle answer</a>, and still hadn't spotted OBESE, so went with CHOSE and got lucky for my four.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-wordle"><span>What is Wordle?</span></h3>
<p>If you're on this page then you almost certainly know what Wordle is already, and indeed have probably been playing it for a while. And even if you've not been playing it, you must surely have heard of it by now, because it's the viral word game phenomenon that took the world by storm last year and is still going strong in 2024.</p><p>We've got a full guide to the game in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wordle">What is Wordle</a> page, but if you just want a refresher then here are the basics.</p>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is Wordle?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Wordle challenges you to guess a new five-letter word each day. You get six guesses, with each one revealing a little more information. If one of the letters in your guess is in the answer and in the right place, it turns green. If it's in the answer but in the wrong place, it turns yellow. And if it's not in the answer at all it turns gray. Simple, eh?</p><p>It's played online via the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Wordle website</strong></a> or the New York Times' Crossword app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/new-york-times-crossword/id307569751" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nytimes.crossword" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Android</a>), and is entirely free. </p><p>Crucially, the answer is the same for everyone each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world, rather than just against yourself or the game. The puzzle then resets each day at midnight in your local time, giving you a new challenge, and the chance to extend your streak.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What are the Wordle rules?</h3><p>The rules of Wordle are pretty straightforward, but with a couple of curveballs thrown in for good measure.</p><article class="article__schema-answer"><p><strong>1.</strong> Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Letters that are not in the answer turn gray.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Answers are never plural.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Letters can appear more than once. So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Each guess must be a valid word in Wordle's dictionary. You can't guess ABCDE, for instance.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses unless you play on Hard mode.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> You have six guesses to solve the Wordle.</p><p><strong>9.</strong> You must complete the daily Wordle before midnight in your timezone.</p><p><strong>10.</strong> All answers are drawn from Wordle's list of 2,309 solutions. However…</p><p><strong>11.</strong> Wordle will accept a wider pool of words as guesses – some 10,000 of them. For instance, you can guess a plural such as WORDS. It definitely won't be right (see point 4 above), but Wordle will accept it as a guess.</p></article></section>

<hr>
<p>Today's Wordle answer (game #1294) is… <strong>CHEAP</strong>.</p><p>The problem with playing a random start word each day is that there's no leveling out of the vagaries of fate. If you begin with CRANE, or SLATE, or STARE, there will be good days and bad – and you'll experience them all. But because these are among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/wordle-best-starting-word">best Wordle starting words</a>, they will necessarily serve up more of the good and fewer of the bad.</p><p>However, when you take the random route those probabilities don't apply. A word like BURST – my starter today – is actually a good choice, one that WordleBot rates as 89 out of 99. That's way above the score for ADIEU or AUDIO, for instance. But the problem is that if the day on which I play it doesn't happen to be one of the days when it's helpful, that's that. Done. There's no element of 'Never mind, it'll probably come good tomorrow'.</p><p>BURST <em>should</em> have performed well – it contains three of the most common letters in the game, plus a vowel, and the third most likely starting letter. Unfortunately, it was spectacularly unlucky (10/99 for luck, WordleBot said) today and drew a blank.</p><p>That meant I started the second guess with 750 possible answers, whereas the 'bot had only 13 thanks to CRANE doing well today, and anyone who played CRATE (12), CARET (7) or CARTE (2) will have been happier still.</p><p>CHEAP should not really have been a 4/6 answer; it has a global average of only 3.3, making it even easier than yesterday's CHOSE (3.4). Like that solution, it begins with the very common CH combination, but whereas yesterday you might have been confused by WHOSE or THOSE, CHEAP doesn't have any really similar alternative words to contend with. It's a really simple Wordle to solve.</p><p>However, my cards were marked after that first guess, and though I scored 99/99 for skill on each of the next three attempts, I couldn't beat the standard score.</p><p>Still, things will be better tomorrow, right?

<p>In a different time zone where it's still Thursday? Don't worry – I can give you some clues for Wordle #1293, too.</p>
<ul><li>Wordle yesterday <strong>had vowels in two places</strong>.</li></ul>
<p><em>* Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too). </em></p>

<p><em>* From WordleBot's Top 20 start words</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Yesterday's Wordle answer (game #1293) was… <strong>CHOSE</strong>.</p><p>This one is all about combinations. But then again, aren't most Wordles? Knowing which letters go together is part of the deal here; if you uncover a green S at the start of a word, you immediately know it's probably going to be followed by a T, H or P, with a few other combos further down the list. If you get an H at the end, in all likelihood it's going to be preceded by an S or T.</p><p>CHOSE has very common combinations at both the start and end. At the front of the word you have CH – which is the fifth most common opening pairing after ST, SH, CR and SP. There are 40 CH words among the original 2,309 solutions, so it's always one to look out for.</p><p>At the end, meanwhile, you have SE. This might seem a lot less common; after all, S always goes at the start, right? But it's actually the third most likely letter to appear in that fourth slot, too, and when it does it's regularly followed by an E. The SE ending combination occurs 52 times, putting it fourth after ER (141), LY (56) and CH (also 56).</p><p>Of course whether you stumbled across those patterns or actively looked for them will have depended to an extent on your choice of start word. If you played CRANE, as WordleBot does, you'll have had the first and last letters in place, giving you good hints about what to add next. CRANE left only 14 answers anyway – so a score of 3/6 was on the cards here. That probably explains the super-low global average of 3.4.</p><p>If, however, you began with LUMPY as I did (let's face it – nobody else played <em>that</em>) then you'll have had no information at all beyond the fact that none of those letters were included.</p><p>I still had more than 1,000 words available to me, so did the simple thing and played my ideal start word as my second: STARE. I knew this wouldn't be right after its appearance as an answer a few days ago, but it gave me a green E at the end, and a yellow S, and cut my answers to nine.</p><p>At this point I was greedy, and nearly suffered for it later. I had found seven of the nine words – CHOSE, WHOSE, NOISE, GOOSE, GEESE, NOOSE and DENSE – and should really have guaranteed myself a four by playing another narrowing-down word; WordleBot suggested CROWN.</p><p>Instead, I took a shot at the answer and went with NOISE. This was <em>not</em> guaranteed to give me the solution, in that it could have left a three-way choice between CHOSE, WHOSE and OBESE (the latter of which was one of the two words I hadn't found, along with DOWSE). And inevitably, that's the scenario that played out, with the SE combination turning green and O going yellow.</p><p>I couldn't recall either CHOSE or WHOSE being a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/past-wordle-answers">past Wordle answer</a>, and still hadn't spotted OBESE, so went with CHOSE and got lucky for my four.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-wordle"><span>What is Wordle?</span></h3>
<p>If you're on this page then you almost certainly know what Wordle is already, and indeed have probably been playing it for a while. And even if you've not been playing it, you must surely have heard of it by now, because it's the viral word game phenomenon that took the world by storm last year and is still going strong in 2024.</p><p>We've got a full guide to the game in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wordle">What is Wordle</a> page, but if you just want a refresher then here are the basics.</p>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is Wordle?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Wordle challenges you to guess a new five-letter word each day. You get six guesses, with each one revealing a little more information. If one of the letters in your guess is in the answer and in the right place, it turns green. If it's in the answer but in the wrong place, it turns yellow. And if it's not in the answer at all it turns gray. Simple, eh?</p><p>It's played online via the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Wordle website</strong></a> or the New York Times' Crossword app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/new-york-times-crossword/id307569751" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nytimes.crossword" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Android</a>), and is entirely free. </p><p>Crucially, the answer is the same for everyone each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world, rather than just against yourself or the game. The puzzle then resets each day at midnight in your local time, giving you a new challenge, and the chance to extend your streak.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What are the Wordle rules?</h3><p>The rules of Wordle are pretty straightforward, but with a couple of curveballs thrown in for good measure.</p><article class="article__schema-answer"><p><strong>1.</strong> Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Letters that are not in the answer turn gray.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Answers are never plural.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Letters can appear more than once. So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Each guess must be a valid word in Wordle's dictionary. You can't guess ABCDE, for instance.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses unless you play on Hard mode.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> You have six guesses to solve the Wordle.</p><p><strong>9.</strong> You must complete the daily Wordle before midnight in your timezone.</p><p><strong>10.</strong> All answers are drawn from Wordle's list of 2,309 solutions. However…</p><p><strong>11.</strong> Wordle will accept a wider pool of words as guesses – some 10,000 of them. For instance, you can guess a plural such as WORDS. It definitely won't be right (see point 4 above), but Wordle will accept it as a guess.</p></article></section>

<p>A nice Strands to ease us into the first weekend of 2025, naming the various parts of a car that are excessively expensive to repair should you be unfortunate enough to have a bump.</p><p>I am fortunate in that most of my car accidents have involved inanimate objects that I have hit at about 3 miles per hour while reversing. Although I did also scrape the side of a police vehicle during a driving lesson. I’m a lot safer these days – unless you’re a bollard, post, or garden wall.</p><p>How did you do today? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="mailto:marc.mclaren@futurenet.com">Send me an email</a> and let me know.</p>

But knowing what's gone before is important, because Wordle answers don't repeat – so you could easily be wasting guesses.</p><p>What you need then, is a list of past Wordle answers, and that's what I've made for you here. It's organized by month and you can simply search the page to see whether the word you're thinking of has already been used.</p><p>So pick one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/wordle-best-starting-word">best Wordle starting words</a>, take a look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wordle-today">today's Wordle answer</a> if you need to and keep this list close when you're playing – your streak will thank you.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-past-wordle-answers-the-full-list"><span>Past Wordle answers: The full list</span></h2>
<p>Below you'll find a list of every Wordle so far – all 1,293 of them (and counting!)</p><p>I've first organized the answers alphabetically, and then by month starting with the most recent. You can use the menus on the side (on desktop) or above (on mobile) to jump straight to the month you want.</p><p>If you're trying to find out whether a specific word has already been an answer, there are easy ways to search for it:</p>
<ul><li>Windows: click <strong>CTRL+F</strong></li><li>macOS: click <strong>CMD+F</strong></li><li>iOS: click <strong>Share</strong> (the box with the arrow), then <strong>'Find on page'</strong></li><li>Android: click the <strong>three dots</strong> in the top-right then <strong>'Find in page'</strong></li></ul>
<p>In each case, simply type in the word you're looking for, and if it has already been an answer you can use the arrows to navigate to it. Right, on with the list…</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-past-wordle-answers-days-with-two-answers"><span>Past Wordle answers: Days with two answers</span></h3>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>On which days have there been two Wordle answers?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>One of the key things about Wordle is that everyone gets the same answer each day. Or is it? There have been four occasions when the game has served up two different solutions, causing no end of consternation among players.</p><p>The first two were victims of the New York Times' purchase of the game in February 2022. The NYT removed around a dozen words that it decided were too difficult for players, or that were in some way controversial.</p><p>However, at that time people could play either via the NYT's games site, or via the original Wordle website created by Josh Wardle. And unfortunately, the changes made by the NYT didn't always filter through correctly to the original version.</p><p>The result was that on February 15, 2022 some people got AROMA and some the much harder AGORA for puzzle #241. Then on March 30, the same thing happened with STOVE and HARRY for game #284; the NYT thought people would only consider HARRY to be a name, and not a verb (as in to harrass), so it removed it.</p><p>The problem reoccurred in May 2022. On May 10 (game #324), the NYT <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/wordle-disaster-as-two-different-answers-appear-on-the-same-day">removed the word FETUS</a> in the wake of the US Supreme Court's decision to repeal Roe vs Wade, deeming it too controversial. Instead, most players got SHINE. The next day, some players got GECKO while others received BUTCH, due to the NYT's servers not yet having reset for everyone from the previous day's change.</p></article></section>

                                <p>Memorizing all of the past Wordle answers is nearly impossible – after all, there have now been more than 1,200 of them. But knowing what's gone before is important, because Wordle answers don't repeat – so you could easily be wasting guesses.</p><p>What you need then, is a list of past Wordle answers, and that's what I've made for you here. It's organized by month and you can simply search the page to see whether the word you're thinking of has already been used.</p><p>So pick one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/wordle-best-starting-word">best Wordle starting words</a>, take a look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wordle-today">today's Wordle answer</a> if you need to and keep this list close when you're playing – your streak will thank you.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-past-wordle-answers-the-full-list"><span>Past Wordle answers: The full list</span></h2>
<p>Below you'll find a list of every Wordle so far – all 1,293 of them (and counting!)</p><p>I've first organized the answers alphabetically, and then by month starting with the most recent. You can use the menus on the side (on desktop) or above (on mobile) to jump straight to the month you want.</p><p>If you're trying to find out whether a specific word has already been an answer, there are easy ways to search for it:</p>
<ul><li>Windows: click <strong>CTRL+F</strong></li><li>macOS: click <strong>CMD+F</strong></li><li>iOS: click <strong>Share</strong> (the box with the arrow), then <strong>'Find on page'</strong></li><li>Android: click the <strong>three dots</strong> in the top-right then <strong>'Find in page'</strong></li></ul>
<p>In each case, simply type in the word you're looking for, and if it has already been an answer you can use the arrows to navigate to it. Right, on with the list…</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-past-wordle-answers-days-with-two-answers"><span>Past Wordle answers: Days with two answers</span></h3>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>On which days have there been two Wordle answers?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>One of the key things about Wordle is that everyone gets the same answer each day. Or is it? There have been four occasions when the game has served up two different solutions, causing no end of consternation among players.</p><p>The first two were victims of the New York Times' purchase of the game in February 2022. The NYT removed around a dozen words that it decided were too difficult for players, or that were in some way controversial.</p><p>However, at that time people could play either via the NYT's games site, or via the original Wordle website created by Josh Wardle. And unfortunately, the changes made by the NYT didn't always filter through correctly to the original version.</p><p>The result was that on February 15, 2022 some people got AROMA and some the much harder AGORA for puzzle #241. Then on March 30, the same thing happened with STOVE and HARRY for game #284; the NYT thought people would only consider HARRY to be a name, and not a verb (as in to harrass), so it removed it.</p><p>The problem reoccurred in May 2022. On May 10 (game #324), the NYT <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/wordle-disaster-as-two-different-answers-appear-on-the-same-day">removed the word FETUS</a> in the wake of the US Supreme Court's decision to repeal Roe vs Wade, deeming it too controversial. Instead, most players got SHINE. The next day, some players got GECKO while others received BUTCH, due to the NYT's servers not yet having reset for everyone from the previous day's change.</p></article></section>

<hr>
<p>No, it’s not an AirTag 2, but Apple’s AirTag now comes with a warning label attached to the box and a symbol by the battery door to make the item tracker complaint with Reese’s Law in the United States, according to a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2025/CPSC-Secures-Agreement-with-Apple-for-Enhanced-Warnings-to-Protect-Children-from-Hazards-of-Battery-Ingestion-Apple-Takes-Action-to-Address-Labeling-Violations-on-AirTags" target="_blank"><u>notice issued by U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission</u></a>.</p><p>While Apple’s item tracker has come under scrutiny for unwanted tracking, this time, Apple’s item tracker is now in line with Reese’s Law's “warning label requirements” after being in violation.</p><p>The law is all about having the proper warning labels and notices on products with ‘button cell or coin batteries’ to prevent children from ‘life threatening ingestion.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3949px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DmUH7rLjv4WD5SHgerNkB4" name="AirTag-in-grass.jpg" alt="An AirTag lying in grass with the metal side facing upwards" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DmUH7rLjv4WD5SHgerNkB4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3949" height="2221" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TechRadar)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since its launch, Apple’s AirTag has had the proper mechanism for keeping the battery in place. However, units imported after the effective date of Reese’s Law – March 19, 2024 – were not in compliance because they were missing the label on the box or on the battery door for the tracker itself.</p><p>The company is now affixing a label to the box warning of the battery and to help prevent ingestion, as well as adding an icon to the interior of the door on the AirTag itself.</p><p>Additionally, since units were sold without the proper labels, an update to the Find My app’s interface for changing the battery warns “about the hazards of button and coin cell batteries.”</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2025/CPSC-Secures-Agreement-with-Apple-for-Enhanced-Warnings-to-Protect-Children-from-Hazards-of-Battery-Ingestion-Apple-Takes-Action-to-Address-Labeling-Violations-on-AirTags" target="_blank"><u>CPSC</u></a> worked with Apple to get the AirTag in line with Reese’s Law and is the one issuing the release revealing how the company is now compliant with the law. It’s a win-win, especially for consumer protection and hopefully to prevent battery ingestion.</p><p>Apple’s AirTag has been on the market since 2021 and has proven to be a very handy item tracker that works seamlessly with the iPhone, among other devices. One of the main benefits is that it has a user-replaceable battery, so making it safer and clearer of the potential dangers is important.</p><p>Of course, as with most Apple products, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/phone-accessories/better-apple-airtags-are-coming-with-new-airtag-2-rumors-predicting-these-two-big-upgrades"><u>rumors are swirling around a successor to the original AirTag</u></a> with better privacy and improved connectivity. That second-generation AirTag could arrive later this year, but for now, the current model is in line with Reese’s Law.</p>

                                <ul><li><strong>The U.S. CPSC has announced that Apple's AirTag is now inline with Reese's Law.</strong></li><li><strong>Apple's item tracker now features additional warnings about it's potential battery hazards.</strong></li><li><strong>The law is centered around preventing 'life threatening ingestion of button cell or coin batteries'.</strong></li></ul>
<hr>
<p>No, it’s not an AirTag 2, but Apple’s AirTag now comes with a warning label attached to the box and a symbol by the battery door to make the item tracker complaint with Reese’s Law in the United States, according to a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2025/CPSC-Secures-Agreement-with-Apple-for-Enhanced-Warnings-to-Protect-Children-from-Hazards-of-Battery-Ingestion-Apple-Takes-Action-to-Address-Labeling-Violations-on-AirTags" target="_blank"><u>notice issued by U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission</u></a>.</p><p>While Apple’s item tracker has come under scrutiny for unwanted tracking, this time, Apple’s item tracker is now in line with Reese’s Law's “warning label requirements” after being in violation.</p><p>The law is all about having the proper warning labels and notices on products with ‘button cell or coin batteries’ to prevent children from ‘life threatening ingestion.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3949px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DmUH7rLjv4WD5SHgerNkB4" name="AirTag-in-grass.jpg" alt="An AirTag lying in grass with the metal side facing upwards" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DmUH7rLjv4WD5SHgerNkB4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3949" height="2221" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TechRadar)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since its launch, Apple’s AirTag has had the proper mechanism for keeping the battery in place. However, units imported after the effective date of Reese’s Law – March 19, 2024 – were not in compliance because they were missing the label on the box or on the battery door for the tracker itself.</p><p>The company is now affixing a label to the box warning of the battery and to help prevent ingestion, as well as adding an icon to the interior of the door on the AirTag itself.</p><p>Additionally, since units were sold without the proper labels, an update to the Find My app’s interface for changing the battery warns “about the hazards of button and coin cell batteries.”</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2025/CPSC-Secures-Agreement-with-Apple-for-Enhanced-Warnings-to-Protect-Children-from-Hazards-of-Battery-Ingestion-Apple-Takes-Action-to-Address-Labeling-Violations-on-AirTags" target="_blank"><u>CPSC</u></a> worked with Apple to get the AirTag in line with Reese’s Law and is the one issuing the release revealing how the company is now compliant with the law. It’s a win-win, especially for consumer protection and hopefully to prevent battery ingestion.</p><p>Apple’s AirTag has been on the market since 2021 and has proven to be a very handy item tracker that works seamlessly with the iPhone, among other devices. One of the main benefits is that it has a user-replaceable battery, so making it safer and clearer of the potential dangers is important.</p><p>Of course, as with most Apple products, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/phone-accessories/better-apple-airtags-are-coming-with-new-airtag-2-rumors-predicting-these-two-big-upgrades"><u>rumors are swirling around a successor to the original AirTag</u></a> with better privacy and improved connectivity. That second-generation AirTag could arrive later this year, but for now, the current model is in line with Reese’s Law.</p>

<h2 id="agi-2">AGI</h2>
<p>The first thing on Altman’s list is AGI. AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence and is the next level of artificial intelligence, where we create human-equivalent, or smarter-than-human intelligence, which some people think comes with as many dangers as opportunities.</p><p>I don’t think we’ll be getting AGI in 2025 despite it being top of the wishlist. When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/well-the-end-of-aging-and-death-wouldnt-be-bad-professor-who-coined-the-term-agi-for-superintelligence-thinks-well-get-human-level-ai-in-three-to-five-years">interviewed Dr Ben Goertzel</a>, one of the people who created the term AGI, last year he thought that 2029 was a more realistic date for it, but that's not to say that companies like OpenAI won't make some significant strides towards it in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="agents-2">Agents</h2>
<p>The second thing listed on Alman’s list is Agents. These are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/our-predictions-for-ai-in-2025-what-next-for-chatgpt-apple-intelligence-and-more">automated AI bots</a> that can perform tasks for you, and act like a true personal assistant, perhaps rescheduling missed appointments or ordering food items you’ve run out of.</p><p>We were expecting OpenAI to release its long-awaited Operator Agent as part of its ‘<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/live/12-days-of-open-ai-live-blog">12 days of OpenAI</a>’, but we were left disappointed. Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/openais-next-giant-breakthrough-tipped-to-land-soon-and-control-your-computer">Operator Agent was supposed to be released in January,</a> we’re expecting OpenAI to release something in the very near future.</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-improvements-2">ChatGPT improvements</h2>
<p>I’m assuming that most parts of the wishlist referred to ChatGPT, specifically: longer context, more personalization, “grown up mode”, much better 4o upgrade, deep research feature and much better memory.</p><p>It’s been noticed that the rate of improvements in Large Language Models is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/google-ceo-expects-ai-development-to-slow-down-in-2025-but-dont-start-celebrating-the-end-of-the-ai-craze">slowing down</a> significantly the more they evolve, so  people’s everyday experience of ChatGPT is not as significantly different between the 4o model and the new o1 model as it was between the older ChatGPT 3 and ChatGPT 4 models. It’s interesting to note that most of the requested changes are not about the ability to answer deep math questions or generate better code, but rather they’re about more simple things like a better memory of who it’s talking to and a more personalized user experience.</p><p>Call me superficial, but I would love these things too. It’s not immediately clear what a “grown up mode” means, but presumably, this would involve taking off some of the guardrails that ChatGPT currently works within. Personally, I think they’re there for a good reason, so I’m not sure how I feel about that.</p>

<h2 id="a-better-sora-2">A better Sora</h2>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/this-is-too-easy-i-just-used-sora-for-the-first-time-and-it-blew-my-mind">Sora</a> was released, to a lot of praise, as part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/live/12-days-of-open-ai-live-blog">‘12 days of OpenAI</a>’ event, and while it is without doubt one of the best AI video generators out there, its long development process (it was announced in February 2024)  has allowed others to catch up.</p><p>While it may sound ungrateful to ask for a "better Sora" so soon after its release, rivals like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/pika-challenges-openai-and-sora-with-new-ai-video-generator-features">Pika</a> can already do things that it can’t do and are stealing its thunder. I'd like to see a more practical Sora. Give me some more reasons why I'd want to create AI video. We're not all budding film directors, and some of us just want to use AI to make our lives easier.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-i-love-to-see-2">What would I love to see?</h2>
<p>I don’t think the world is quite ready for AGI yet, even if it was a technical possibility. Of everything on the wishlist, improvements to ChatGPT top my list. Particularly better memory, a feature that Google is spending a lot of time developing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/heres-why-googles-gemini-ai-getting-a-proper-memory-could-save-lives">ChatGPT rival Gemini</a>, along with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/you-can-now-try-gemini-2-0-in-experimental-advanced-mode-if-youre-a-gemini-advanced-subscriber">deep research feature</a>.</p><p>To finish off his tweet, Altman ended with the enigmatic, “Interestingly, many great updates we have coming were mentioned not at all or very little!”</p><p>Perhaps he’s just trying to keep us on our toes about what 2025 will look like, but wondering what OpenAI is going to come up with that's not on the wishlist has certainly whetted my appetite for 2025. Bring it on!</p>

Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/openais-next-giant-breakthrough-tipped-to-land-soon-and-control-your-computer">Operator Agent was supposed to be released in January,</a> we’re expecting OpenAI to release something in the very near future.</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-improvements-6">ChatGPT improvements</h2>
<p>I’m assuming that most parts of the wishlist referred to ChatGPT, specifically: longer context, more personalization, “grown up mode”, much better 4o upgrade, deep research feature and much better memory.</p><p>It’s been noticed that the rate of improvements in Large Language Models is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/google-ceo-expects-ai-development-to-slow-down-in-2025-but-dont-start-celebrating-the-end-of-the-ai-craze">slowing down</a> significantly the more they evolve, so  people’s everyday experience of ChatGPT is not as significantly different between the 4o model and the new o1 model as it was between the older ChatGPT 3 and ChatGPT 4 models. It’s interesting to note that most of the requested changes are not about the ability to answer deep math questions or generate better code, but rather they’re about more simple things like a better memory of who it’s talking to and a more personalized user experience.</p><p>Call me superficial, but I would love these things too. It’s not immediately clear what a “grown up mode” means, but presumably, this would involve taking off some of the guardrails that ChatGPT currently works within. Personally, I think they’re there for a good reason, so I’m not sure how I feel about that.</p>

I'd like to see a more practical Sora. Give me some more reasons why I'd want to create AI video. We're not all budding film directors, and some of us just want to use AI to make our lives easier.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-i-love-to-see-6">What would I love to see?</h2>
<p>I don’t think the world is quite ready for AGI yet, even if it was a technical possibility. Of everything on the wishlist, improvements to ChatGPT top my list. Particularly better memory, a feature that Google is spending a lot of time developing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/heres-why-googles-gemini-ai-getting-a-proper-memory-could-save-lives">ChatGPT rival Gemini</a>, along with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/you-can-now-try-gemini-2-0-in-experimental-advanced-mode-if-youre-a-gemini-advanced-subscriber">deep research feature</a>.</p><p>To finish off his tweet, Altman ended with the enigmatic, “Interestingly, many great updates we have coming were mentioned not at all or very little!”</p><p>Perhaps he’s just trying to keep us on our toes about what 2025 will look like, but wondering what OpenAI is going to come up with that's not on the wishlist has certainly whetted my appetite for 2025. Bring it on!</p>

<h2 id="apple-watch-deals-is-the-price-worth-it-2">Apple Watch deals: is the price worth it? </h2>
<p>Apple's hardware often comes with a high price tag, and the Apple Watch doesn't fall far from the tree. That said, if you're looking for a smartwatch to work with your iPhone, no other brand comes close to offering the functionality of Apple's own timepiece. <br><br>While the Apple Watch price is still higher than many other brands, you're paying for integration with a massive number of apps you're already using on your iPhone. Plus, with all the Apple Watch deals happening and the recent software updates to older models, you can easily grab a great bargain. </p>
<h2 id="apple-watch-deals-from-phone-carriers-2">Apple Watch deals from phone carriers</h2>
<p>If you're looking for an Apple Watch deal with a Cellular plan, a phone carrier like Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile could be your best option. Purchasing an Apple Watch from a carrier allows you to make monthly payments, and you can typically find discounts, especially if you have an existing phone plan with them.</p>

<p>Your Apple Watch literally isn’t complete without the best deals on Apple Watch bands. They make the geeky smartwatch stylish enough to show off to late adopters.</p><p>In fact, you’re going to want multiple cheap Apple Watch straps simply because more elegant bands are far from ideal for the gym. Vice versa, Sport Bands don’t cut it at the fancy dinner table.</p><p>Everyday in the news, we see new cheap Apple Watch bands trying to become the de facto alternative to the more expensive, official Apple Watch bands, and they’re usually just as good. Trust us, buying a trio of third-party, lookalike Apple Watch bands for the price of one official strap is a relief after paying so much for the smartwatch itself. </p>

Apple's new chip also brings new capabilities to the Apple Watch, such as the double-tap gesture, which allows you to control your smartwatch by simply tapping your index and thumb together twice. You also get a brighter display, watchOS 10 with redesigned apps, and for the first time ever, Siri requests can now be processed from your smartwatch.</p>

<h2 id="apple-watch-deals-is-the-price-worth-it-6">Apple Watch deals: is the price worth it? </h2>
<p>Apple's hardware often comes with a high price tag, and the Apple Watch doesn't fall far from the tree. That said, if you're looking for a smartwatch to work with your iPhone, no other brand comes close to offering the functionality of Apple's own timepiece. <br><br>While the Apple Watch price is still higher than many other brands, you're paying for integration with a massive number of apps you're already using on your iPhone. Plus, with all the Apple Watch deals happening and the recent software updates to older models, you can easily grab a great bargain. </p>
<h2 id="apple-watch-deals-from-phone-carriers-6">Apple Watch deals from phone carriers</h2>
<p>If you're looking for an Apple Watch deal with a Cellular plan, a phone carrier like Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile could be your best option. Purchasing an Apple Watch from a carrier allows you to make monthly payments, and you can typically find discounts, especially if you have an existing phone plan with them.</p>

<p>Your Apple Watch literally isn’t complete without the best deals on Apple Watch bands. They make the geeky smartwatch stylish enough to show off to late adopters.</p><p>In fact, you’re going to want multiple cheap Apple Watch straps simply because more elegant bands are far from ideal for the gym. Vice versa, Sport Bands don’t cut it at the fancy dinner table.</p><p>Everyday in the news, we see new cheap Apple Watch bands trying to become the de facto alternative to the more expensive, official Apple Watch bands, and they’re usually just as good. Trust us, buying a trio of third-party, lookalike Apple Watch bands for the price of one official strap is a relief after paying so much for the smartwatch itself. </p>

<p>The official AirPods' price is $159 in the US and £159 in the UK and $249 in Australia. So you shouldn't pay any more.

<hr>
<p>The recent cyberattack which hit security firm Cyberhaven and then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/google-chrome-extensions-targeted-by-hackers-to-steal-user-passwords">affected a number of Google Chrome extenions</a> may have been part of a ‘wider campaign’, new research has claimed.</p><p>A<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-details-reveal-how-hackers-hijacked-35-google-chrome-extensions/" target="_blank"> BleepingComputer </a>investigation found the same code was injected into at least 35 Google Chrome extensions, which are being used by roughly 2.6 million users worldwide. This led to 400,000 devices being infected with malicious code through the CyberHaven extensions.</p><p>The campaign started as early as December 5, over two weeks earlier than first suspected, although command and control subdomains have been found dating back as far as March 2024.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Apple's Dynamic Island, that pill-shaped and wholly fungible black space that sits atop your iPhone 16 (along with iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 Pro models), is relatively small in the scheme of things. As measured by me, it usually sits between 22mm and 32 mm wide and 6mm deep – unless you touch it and then it can expand to 7 centimeters wide by almost 3 centimeters deep.</p><p>It's a sometimes useful space, but it's also screen real estate that I'm tired of giving up.</p><p>Please understand that I'm generally a Dynamic Island fan and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-review">wrote about it lovingly in 2022</a> (I called it "clever and impressive"). But I'm a bigger fan of everything else happening on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> screen and grow weary of this rather large and often mostly dark cutout.</p><p>I started pondering the future of this space again after a spate of new rumors regarding Apple's possible plans for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-17-pro">iPhone 17</a>. Some claim Apple might be looking to reduce the size of the island <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bgr.com/tech/apple-leaker-reveals-marquee-features-for-several-future-iphone-models/" target="_blank">by shrinking the components contained within it</a>.</p><p>One of the reasons I like the Dynamic Island is because it's not just dead space, and it's also not all screen. Instead, the Dynamic Island is a clever combination of the two. There's a proximity sensor, an infrared projector (a.k.a Time of Flight [ToF] sensor), and a 12MP camera.</p><p>Before the Dynamic Island, there was the TrueDepth notch, which was introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-x-review">iPhone X</a> as part of the then-new Face ID system. I also love Face ID with all my heart. It's so much more efficient than unlocking your phone, apps, and services with your finger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.77%;"><img id="g2H3JGK8myARNdNpQE4omF" name="Dynamic-Island-illuminated" alt="Dynamic Island" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g2H3JGK8myARNdNpQE4omF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1282" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A closer look at the Dynamic Island </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="island-living-2">Island living</h2>
<p>What Apple did with the Dynamic Island is it moved the notch down and into the screen space and then sliced it up so that the three components are bisected between the two sensors and the one camera by a tiny bit of active screen. This is how notifications and display elements notifying you of system activity (a red dot to show you the camera or microphone is active, for instance) appear between the Face ID sensor and the camera lens.</p><p>I like this effect and how Apple designed all the Dynamic Island animations to make it appear as if the pill smoothly grows and shrinks to fit the current purpose. It's all so well done.</p><p>Even so, I want as near an unblemished iPhone 17 screen as possible – what the iPhone display was before the iPhone X. I know it was smaller and of a lower resolution, but it had no weird notch, not even a cutout.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xF7S5rfE8GYaT56Mqa8ME" name="Apple iPhone (2007).jpg" alt="Apple iPhone (2007)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xF7S5rfE8GYaT56Mqa8ME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The OG iPhone screen </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the world of modern, edge-to-edge displays, this is almost but not quite a pipe dream. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S24,</a> for instance, has just a tiny drill-through for the front-facing camera. On the interior flexible screen of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-an-excellent-foldable-makes-another-leap-ahead">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, Samsung covers the camera cutout with pixels that disappear when it's time to take a selfie.</p><p>This is what I want for the iPhone 17. No more half-measures to accommodate the True Depth Module. I want Apple to find a way to permanently hide Face ID and the proximity sensor behind the display. I wonder if one of them can be shrunk enough to live in the ultra-thin screen bezel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1902px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.47%;"><img id="MAssYadygGeP46p7TmhpUj" name="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review Paris-4.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 in Paris in front of the Louvre pyramid" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MAssYadygGeP46p7TmhpUj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1902" height="1074" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">It's not easy to spot the camera on this Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, is it? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the 12MP (or maybe 48PM) front-facing camera, let's go the Samsung route and hide it with live pixels that shift to transparent when it's selfie time.</p><p>You might think this will kill the Dynamic Island. It might, but the concept of surfacing app status and other activity notifications could be handed over to Siri. Maybe it could sometimes go from the screen surrounding glow to a Dynamic Island-like animation that briefly appears at the top of the screen. I'd enable it when you shake the phone.</p><p>Considering that Siri's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/apple-intelligence-explained">Apple Intelligence</a> update is supposed to bring more third-party app knowledge to its digital assistant, I think this makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-raft-2">Building a raft</h2>
<p>Even if Apple does away with the physical island and all those little status notifications, will we miss it that much? How often do we have to stare at our phones to know what's going on? If the status or activity update is that important, it should be a notification.</p><p>There's a non-zero-percent chance this will happen. The iPhone 17 could, after all, be a major handset redesign. We think it'll <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/new-leak-predicts-just-how-thin-the-iphone-17-air-is-going-to-be">be a lot thinner</a> (at least one model, usually referred to as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/new-leak-predicts-just-how-thin-the-iphone-17-air-is-going-to-be">iPhone 17 Air</a>) and have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/this-iphone-17-pro-camera-rumor-is-making-me-hesitate-about-getting-a-16-pro-heres-why">way better cameras</a>. If the screen undergoes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-iphone-17-could-have-a-screen-upgrade-weve-been-waiting-years-for">a major update</a>, like the tandem OLED technology in the ultra-thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tablets/ipad-pro/ipad-pro-13-inch-2024">iPad Pro M4 13-inch</a>, then the removal of the Dynamic Island makes some sense.</p><p>It's not that I don't appreciate the Dynamic Island, but sometimes I feel like I've been stranded on (or at least with) it, and I'm ready for a rescue.</p>

As measured by me, it usually sits between 22mm and 32 mm wide and 6mm deep – unless you touch it and then it can expand to 7 centimeters wide by almost 3 centimeters deep.</p><p>It's a sometimes useful space, but it's also screen real estate that I'm tired of giving up.</p><p>Please understand that I'm generally a Dynamic Island fan and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-review">wrote about it lovingly in 2022</a> (I called it "clever and impressive"). But I'm a bigger fan of everything else happening on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> screen and grow weary of this rather large and often mostly dark cutout.</p><p>I started pondering the future of this space again after a spate of new rumors regarding Apple's possible plans for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-17-pro">iPhone 17</a>. Some claim Apple might be looking to reduce the size of the island <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bgr.com/tech/apple-leaker-reveals-marquee-features-for-several-future-iphone-models/" target="_blank">by shrinking the components contained within it</a>.</p><p>One of the reasons I like the Dynamic Island is because it's not just dead space, and it's also not all screen. Instead, the Dynamic Island is a clever combination of the two. There's a proximity sensor, an infrared projector (a.k.a Time of Flight [ToF] sensor), and a 12MP camera.</p><p>Before the Dynamic Island, there was the TrueDepth notch, which was introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-x-review">iPhone X</a> as part of the then-new Face ID system. I also love Face ID with all my heart. It's so much more efficient than unlocking your phone, apps, and services with your finger.</p>

<h2 id="island-living-6">Island living</h2>
<p>What Apple did with the Dynamic Island is it moved the notch down and into the screen space and then sliced it up so that the three components are bisected between the two sensors and the one camera by a tiny bit of active screen. This is how notifications and display elements notifying you of system activity (a red dot to show you the camera or microphone is active, for instance) appear between the Face ID sensor and the camera lens.</p><p>I like this effect and how Apple designed all the Dynamic Island animations to make it appear as if the pill smoothly grows and shrinks to fit the current purpose. It's all so well done.</p><p>Even so, I want as near an unblemished iPhone 17 screen as possible – what the iPhone display was before the iPhone X. I know it was smaller and of a lower resolution, but it had no weird notch, not even a cutout.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xF7S5rfE8GYaT56Mqa8ME" name="Apple iPhone (2007).jpg" alt="Apple iPhone (2007)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xF7S5rfE8GYaT56Mqa8ME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The OG iPhone screen </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the world of modern, edge-to-edge displays, this is almost but not quite a pipe dream. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S24,</a> for instance, has just a tiny drill-through for the front-facing camera. On the interior flexible screen of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-an-excellent-foldable-makes-another-leap-ahead">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, Samsung covers the camera cutout with pixels that disappear when it's time to take a selfie.</p><p>This is what I want for the iPhone 17. No more half-measures to accommodate the True Depth Module. I want Apple to find a way to permanently hide Face ID and the proximity sensor behind the display. I wonder if one of them can be shrunk enough to live in the ultra-thin screen bezel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1902px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.47%;"><img id="MAssYadygGeP46p7TmhpUj" name="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review Paris-4.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 in Paris in front of the Louvre pyramid" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MAssYadygGeP46p7TmhpUj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1902" height="1074" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">It's not easy to spot the camera on this Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, is it? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the 12MP (or maybe 48PM) front-facing camera, let's go the Samsung route and hide it with live pixels that shift to transparent when it's selfie time.</p><p>You might think this will kill the Dynamic Island. It might, but the concept of surfacing app status and other activity notifications could be handed over to Siri. Maybe it could sometimes go from the screen surrounding glow to a Dynamic Island-like animation that briefly appears at the top of the screen. I'd enable it when you shake the phone.</p><p>Considering that Siri's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/apple-intelligence-explained">Apple Intelligence</a> update is supposed to bring more third-party app knowledge to its digital assistant, I think this makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-raft-6">Building a raft</h2>
<p>Even if Apple does away with the physical island and all those little status notifications, will we miss it that much? How often do we have to stare at our phones to know what's going on? If the status or activity update is that important, it should be a notification.</p><p>There's a non-zero-percent chance this will happen. The iPhone 17 could, after all, be a major handset redesign. We think it'll <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/new-leak-predicts-just-how-thin-the-iphone-17-air-is-going-to-be">be a lot thinner</a> (at least one model, usually referred to as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/new-leak-predicts-just-how-thin-the-iphone-17-air-is-going-to-be">iPhone 17 Air</a>) and have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/this-iphone-17-pro-camera-rumor-is-making-me-hesitate-about-getting-a-16-pro-heres-why">way better cameras</a>. If the screen undergoes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-iphone-17-could-have-a-screen-upgrade-weve-been-waiting-years-for">a major update</a>, like the tandem OLED technology in the ultra-thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tablets/ipad-pro/ipad-pro-13-inch-2024">iPad Pro M4 13-inch</a>, then the removal of the Dynamic Island makes some sense.</p><p>It's not that I don't appreciate the Dynamic Island, but sometimes I feel like I've been stranded on (or at least with) it, and I'm ready for a rescue.</p>

<hr>
<p>Microsoft has boldly suggested its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/utilities/other-software/microsoft-edge-1292485/review">Edge</a> browser has been central to the AI experience for users across the world over the last 12 months.</p><p>In a blog <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2024/12/19/2024-year-in-review-a-look-back-at-your-year-with-microsoft-edge/" target="_blank">post</a>, the company's General Manager for Product Management and Growth at Microsoft Edge, Search and Mobile, Roger Capriotti, revealed users accessed Copilot within the Edge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/browser">browser</a> window to engage in over 10 billion generative AI chats in 2024.</p><p>Edge has also, apparently, proven instrumental in other areas, like improving accessibility with built-in translation and supporting the world of ecommerce.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft-gives-us-edge-unwrapped-2024-2">Microsoft gives us Edge unwrapped: 2024</h2>
<p>An estimated 38 trillion characters were translated using Edge’s auto-translate function in 2024, with built-in shopping features saving shoppers $400 per year on average. Furthermore, 800 million articles and stories were consumed on MSN, with 46 million messages and files shared with Drop.</p><p>Capriotti also drew attention to the browser’s performance enhancements, quantifying their usefulness by stating seven trillion megabytes of PC memory were saved by using sleeping tabs.</p><p>Security features also got a major mention for the role in preventing over 1.4 billion phishing, malware, and scam attacks on Edge and over 1.8 trillion trackers on the Edge mobile app.</p><p>However despite all this success, Edge still lags behind in the global browser market. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-chrome">Google Chrome</a> accounts for two in three (67%) desktop browser sessions (via the December 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" target="_blank">Statcounter</a> figures), with Edge in a very distant second place (13%). Across all platforms, including smartphones and tablets, Edge resides in third place with a tiny 5% market share, second to Safari (17%).</p><p>The update also notes Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, however it, too, lags behind competition.

<hr>
<p>Microsoft has boldly suggested its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/utilities/other-software/microsoft-edge-1292485/review">Edge</a> browser has been central to the AI experience for users across the world over the last 12 months.</p><p>In a blog <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2024/12/19/2024-year-in-review-a-look-back-at-your-year-with-microsoft-edge/" target="_blank">post</a>, the company's General Manager for Product Management and Growth at Microsoft Edge, Search and Mobile, Roger Capriotti, revealed users accessed Copilot within the Edge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/browser">browser</a> window to engage in over 10 billion generative AI chats in 2024.</p><p>Edge has also, apparently, proven instrumental in other areas, like improving accessibility with built-in translation and supporting the world of ecommerce.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft-gives-us-edge-unwrapped-2024-6">Microsoft gives us Edge unwrapped: 2024</h2>
<p>An estimated 38 trillion characters were translated using Edge’s auto-translate function in 2024, with built-in shopping features saving shoppers $400 per year on average. Furthermore, 800 million articles and stories were consumed on MSN, with 46 million messages and files shared with Drop.</p><p>Capriotti also drew attention to the browser’s performance enhancements, quantifying their usefulness by stating seven trillion megabytes of PC memory were saved by using sleeping tabs.</p><p>Security features also got a major mention for the role in preventing over 1.4 billion phishing, malware, and scam attacks on Edge and over 1.8 trillion trackers on the Edge mobile app.</p><p>However despite all this success, Edge still lags behind in the global browser market. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-chrome">Google Chrome</a> accounts for two in three (67%) desktop browser sessions (via the December 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" target="_blank">Statcounter</a> figures), with Edge in a very distant second place (13%). Across all platforms, including smartphones and tablets, Edge resides in third place with a tiny 5% market share, second to Safari (17%).</p><p>The update also notes Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, however it, too, lags behind competition. Google, with a 90% market share, leads the way, with Bing taking just a 4% slice.</p><p>Looking ahead, Microsoft is hoping injecting artificial intelligence into its browser to improve its usefulness could be one way to help it boost takeup.</p>

The wait is on now that we have that announcement window, though there is still very little concrete information about the console itself.</p><p>The last hardware refresh that the Nintendo Switch received was with the launch of the Nintendo Switch OLED on October 8, 2021. Although the Nintendo Switch OLED boasts an enhanced OLED display, not to mention additional internal storage and improved speakers, there were no substantial upgrades to the power of the machine itself. This is a little problematic as, while the majority of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-nintendo-switch-games">best Nintendo Switch games</a> manage to run smoothly enough, the Nintendo Switch is still powered by a modest Nvidia Tegra X1 chip and just 4GB of RAM.</p><p>Third-party releases like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </em>and <em>Biomutant </em>have really started to push this hardware to its absolute limits, with unstable frame rates and greatly compromised visuals. Even in ideal situations, however, the console can only play games in up to 720p in handheld mode, while that number increases to just to 1080p when in docked mode. Now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a> have been on the market for a few years, both consoles that can play games at a smooth 60 fps and high-fidelity 4K resolution, not to mention the imminent arrival of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, it makes a lot of sense for Nintendo to take things back to the drawing board and improve its hardware to better keep up with the competition.</p><p>But what could be in store for Nintendo fans? Here are all the latest rumors, plus plenty of carefully considered speculation, about the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<h2 id="nintendo-switch-2-cut-to-the-chase-2">Nintendo Switch 2: cut to the chase</h2>
<ul><li><strong>What is it?</strong> The successor to the Nintendo Switch console</li><li><strong>How much will it cost? </strong>TBA</li><li><strong>When will it release? </strong>TBA, but an announcement has been confirmed for before the end of 2025</li><li><strong>What will its upgrades be? </strong>TBA, but more powerful hardware with improvements to RAM, CPU power, and GPU speed, is almost gauranteed. Based on recent leaks, we should expect redesigned controllers too.</li></ul>

<p>Although the Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, though Nintendo has confirmed that the announcement is coming within the fiscal year - which means before 31 March 2025. As for when this announcement will arrive, we certainly wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it lands in early 2025. It could really be any day now.</p><p>Based on the reveal and release timings of the original Nintendo Switch, it seems safe to assume that the console will then hit store shelves in 2025. This lines up with previous reports from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF196OV0Z10C24A2000000/" target="_blank">Japanese media outlet Nikkei</a> that suggest that the console is set to release in 2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="P7fAM2JYVaUeMATqRKxbjL" name="nintendo-switch-worth-it-hero.jpg" alt="Super Mario Odyssey played on a Nintendo Switch in portable mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P7fAM2JYVaUeMATqRKxbjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shutterstock / Wachiwit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nintendo Switch launched for $259.99 / £259.99 / AUD$435, with the newer Nintendo Switch OLED then available for $349.99 / £309.99 / AU$539.95. Given that the Nintendo Switch 2 will likely feature improved hardware compared to both of these models, the asking price is very likely to be higher than those figures.</p><p>For some additional perspective, the PS5 and Xbox Series X sell for $499.99 / £479.99 / AU$799.95 and $499 / £449 / AU$749 respectively. The more powerful PS5 Pro then costs a staggering $699.99 / £699.99 / AU$1,200.</p><p>Nintendo often aims to undercut its competition by offering lower spec hardware at a more affordable price. With this in mind, we wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the Nintendo Switch 2 is priced around $399.99 / £399.99 / AU$699.95 or even slightly lower to keep the competitive edge.</p><p>In short, expect something less expensive than an a PS5 and Xbox Series X, but more than the current Nintendo Switch. That said, you should bear in mind that this is purely an educated guess for the time being.</p>

<p>The most recent rumours regarding potential Nintendo Switch 2 specs come from a spec sheet created by the YouTube content creator Paul Eccleston or “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDiEVX1ZjXA" target="_blank">RedGamingTech</a>”. As explained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-could-be-disappointingly-underpowered-heres-what-we-know">Tom’s Hardware</a>, Eccleston supposedly made the spec sheet with information from his own sources and a report by the Korean United Daily News. This spec sheet suggests that the Nintendo Switch 2 will feature an eight core Cortex-A78AE processor, 8GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal eMMC storage.</p><p>While this is not particularly impressive compared to the PS5 or Xbox Series X, it would still represent an improvement in power compared to all of the current Nintendo Switch models.</p><p>That same source also indicates that the Nintendo Switch 2 could offer hugely improved battery life, in addition to a 120 Hz refresh rate with a 7-inch OLED display. In terms of overall design, Ecclestone says that it is likely to be similar to that of the Nintendo Switch OLED.</p><p>Interestingly, this contradicts older rumors that suggested we may see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/nintendo-switch-pro-could-sport-a-mini-led-display-heres-why-that-matters">mini-LED display</a> used for the screen. According to a report by Taiwan’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/4963550" target="_blank">Economic Daily News</a>, a Nintendo Switch successor could sport mini-LED screens supplied by Innolux.</p><p>Going back even further, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-new-revision-aula-4k/">Wccftech</a> reported that a data miner known as "SciresM" had claimed to have found a reference to a new Nintendo Switch model within the Nintendo Switch’s latest firmware update under the codename &apos;Aula&apos;. Rather than being within the Nintendo Switch itself, this source argues that the hardware improvement “might be inside a new dock and not inside the tablet". They do note, however, that "there’s no way to tell from the firmware code yet.”</p><p>We&apos;ve also seen some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-pro-rumor-looks-legit-thanks-to-this-nvidia-email">Nintendo Switch Pro rumors thanks to a leaked Nvidia</a> email which suggested the existence of the Tegra239 SoC (system on a chip). Reportedly, this was being designed specifically for an upcoming Nintendo Switch model, which could very well mean the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nintendo-switch-2-latest-news-and-rumors"><span>Nintendo Switch 2: latest news and rumors</span></h2>
<p><strong>Will the Switch 2 feature AI upscaling?</strong></p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/will-the-nintendo-switch-2-feature-ai-upscaling-this-patent-suggests-its-on-the-cards">Nintendo patent</a> shows that the company is exploring AI upscaling, potentially so that it can be incorporated into the Nintendo Switch 2. The patent details how such technology could be used to increase graphical fidelity and resolution. It could even keep game file sizes lower by allowing developers to ship low resolution textures that are then upscaled in real time.</p><p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be here soon</strong></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/gaming-industry/the-nintendo-switch-2-could-be-revealed-earlier-than-planned-thanks-to-recent-leaks-per-industry-analyst">According to an industry analyst</a>, Nintendo is likely "aware of all the leaks and not happy about them." In fact, it could even cause the company to reveal the system "earlier than planned" before even more juicy details come out. The analyst also stated that an announcement early in January "could make sense."</p><p><strong>Has the console&apos;s color leaked?</strong></p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/im-hoping-that-this-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-color-leak-isnt-real-because-its-absolutely-hideous">recent leak</a> has suggested that the Nintendo Switch 2 will come in a slightly bizarre colorway. The Joy-Con controllers will reportedly be a mix of blue, orange, and black. Presumably this will involve one black and orange Joy-Con and one black and blue Joy-Con - weird!</p><p><strong>YouTuber reveals first hands-on look</strong></p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-switch/youtuber-seemingly-reveals-the-first-hands-on-look-at-the-nintendo-switch-2-and-its-new-magnetic-joy-cons">YouTuber may have shown us our first hands-on look at the console via a dummy model</a>. NerdNest posted a video explaining that a third-party accessory manufacturer, iVoler, reached out to them with an offer to test a new case alongside a model of the unreleased device.</p><p>When comparing the size of the model to the original Switch, it&apos;s clear that the Switch 2 is bigger in scale and, after measuring, the YouTuber confirmed that the screen itself is "maybe 7.9 or maybe 8 inches, diagonal".</p><p><strong>Dbrand shows us what could be a 3D scan of the console</strong></p><p>Third-party accessory manufacturer Dbrand has given us an even more detailed look at the Switch 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-switch/to-the-surprise-of-absolutely-no-one-another-new-look-at-the-nintendo-switch-2-has-seemingly-leaked">revealing a 3D render</a> reportedly based on a 3D scan of the upcoming console.</p><p>According the this, the Switch 2 is larger and taller tahn the original model but has roughly the same thickness. This means it will measure 270mm wide, 116mm tall, and 14mm thick, compared to the Switch&apos;s measurements of 242mm x 102mm x 13.9mm.</p><p>The Dbrand CEO also stated that the Joy-Cons are magnetically attached, with an ejection button on the back in order to remove it.</p><p><strong>Accessory company may have revealed the first look</strong></p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-switch/new-nintendo-switch-2-leak-may-have-revealed-the-first-look-at-the-new-handheld">accessory manufacturer may have accidentally given us our first look at the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. The company, Satisfye, posted a now-deleted trailer for the ZenGrip 2 - a case designed for the Switch successor. In the trailer we can see a blurry shot o the handheld, which may have been our very first look at it.</p><p>The design shown in the video lines up with previous leaks and rumors. It looked similar to the original Nintendo Switch, but larger and with a mysterious extra button on its Joy-Con controllers.</p><p><strong>Is this our first confirmed Switch 2 game?</strong></p><p>A recent trailer for <em>Yooka-Replaylee, </em>the upcoming <em>Yooka-Laylee </em>remake, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/playtonic-hints-at-nintendo-switch-2-release-for-yooka-replaylee-with-its-latest-trailer">appears to suggest that the game will be heading to Nintendo&apos;s next console</a>. In an X / Twitter post, developer Playtonic confirmed that the game will be coming to "PS5, Xbox Series and... Nintendo" followed by a cheeky eye emoji. A plain Nintendo logo can also be seen at the end of the trailer alongside the other platforms, which is a noticeable departure from the usual Nintendo Switch emblem. This could very well be our first confirmed Nintendo Switch 2 game.</p><p><strong>Nintendo is still announcing Nintendo Switch bundles</strong></p><p>Despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/even-in-the-face-of-rampant-switch-2-rumors-nintendo-is-still-announcing-new-switch-oled-bundles">rampant Switch 2 rumors</a>, Nintendo still announced its usual holiday bundles. This year we&apos;re getting something a little different from the expected <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>package though, with a brand new Nintendo Switch OLED Super Mario Bros. Wonder bundle. It contains a Nintendo Switch OLED console, plus a copy of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>and a 12 month Nintendo Switch Online membership.</p><p><strong>Nintendo is reportedly working on GameCube controllers</strong></p><p>Could the Nintendo Switch 2 be compatible with GameCube controllers? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/a-new-wave-of-gamecube-controllers-is-reportedly-in-the-works-could-they-be-for-the-nintendo-switch-2">A new wave of GameCube controllers is reportedly in the works</a>, at least according to component shipment details posted to the online gaming forum ResetEra. It&apos;s unclear whether these are intended for the current Nintendo Switch, perhaps as part of a Nintendo Switch Online GameCube library update, or its upcoming successor. We&apos;ll just have to wait and see.</p><p><strong>Nintendo is holding a mysterious play test</strong></p><p>Nintendo is set to hold a play test for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/nintendo-to-hold-playtest-for-a-new-unannounced-switch-online-feature">unannounced Switch Online feature</a> on October 24. There&apos;s no word on what this could be at the moment, but we do know that those interested must have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership to qualify. There&apos;s a slim chance that this might be something to do with the Nintendo Switch 2, potentially getting ready for its launch.</p><p><strong>Nintendo has finally released new hardware... but it&apos;s not the Switch 2</strong></p><p>In a surprising move, Nintendo revealed a brand-new piece of hardware.

It&apos;s a Nintendo-themed alarm clock, with internet connectivity and some unique body tracking features.

MST Financial senior analyst David Gibson commented on the efforts by Hosiden, one of Nintendo&apos;s primary hardware assembles, to increase spending on production equipment and automation "for its major customer in amusement" - likely to be Nintendo. Based on this information, Gibson said that he expects "Sept news and March 2025 release" for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 seems unlikely to arrive before April 2025</strong></p><p>According to reports, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-switch-2-to-launch-in-april-2025-at-the-earliest-according-to-reports">Nintendo Switch 2 will launch in April 2025 at the earliest</a>. This comes from Chris Dring, head of industry website GamesIndustry.biz, who has allegedly spoken to developers about the upcoming console. ""No developer I’ve spoken to expects it to be launching this financial year. In fact, they’ve been told not to expect it in the [current] financial year," he said. "A bunch of people I spoke to hope it’s out in April or May time, still early next year, not late."</p><p><strong>Nintendo has a simple plan to thwart Nintendo Switch 2 resellers</strong></p><p>Speaking at a Q&A during the company&apos;s 84th annual shareholder meeting, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa discussed some plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-has-a-plan-to-combat-potential-switch-2-resellers-simply-make-enough-of-its-next-console">combat potential Nintendo Switch 2 resellers</a>. He said that "as a countermeasure for resale, we believe that it is most important to produce a sufficient number to meet customer demand." Put simply, the idea is that if Nintendo manufactures enough Nintendo Switch 2 units, customers won&apos;t ever feel the need to purchase from resellers at a marked up price.</p><p>We will have to wait and see whether this strategy is effective, but this should still offer some reassurance to those who are worried about having to hunt down limited stock around the launch period.</p><p><strong>Final Fantasy 14 could come to the Nintendo Switch 2</strong></p><p>We might have had our first hint at one of the third-party games that could to the Nintendo Switch 2.

Interestingly, they provided some additional insight that was supposedly gleaned  through their NVIDIA contacts. According to this leaker, the physical hardware powering the Nintendo Switch 2 has been ready for some time but Nintendo has been holding off on revealing the system in order to ensure adequate stock at launch - which lines up with other reports.</p><p><strong>Nintendo president denies Nintendo Switch 2 developer briefings</strong></p><p>Following our report that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-tech-demos-took-place-at-gamescom">Nintendo Switch 2 tech demos took place at Gamescom 2023</a>, which was confirmed by our own sources, Nintendo company president Shuntaro Furukawa denied that any such briefings took place.

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-should-you-wait-for-the-nintendo-switch-2"><span>Should you wait for the Nintendo Switch 2?</span></h3>
<p>The question of whether you should wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 is something that&apos;s likely going to be on every gamer&apos;s mind in the lead up to the console&apos;s official reveal and subsequent release. As with a lot of things, however, the answer here really depends on your specific needs and what you want out of a console.</p><p>If you&apos;re just looking for a way to play the existing library of Nintendo Switch games, then the current Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch OLED, or Nintendo Switch Lite are going to be more than enough for you. Given that the console is quite old now, it&apos;s available pretty cheaply and is often part of generous bundles that pack-in a top game or two at no extra cost.</p><p>As the Nintendo Switch 2 will likely cost more than the existing Nintendo Switch, thanks to a combination of general price increases in plenty of consumer tech products over the years and the high likelihood of substantially improved hardware under the hood, Nintendo&apos;s current system is also a great choice if you&apos;re shopping on a budget. In this regard, the Nintendo Switch Lite is especially easy to recommend, as it has occasionally dropped to under $160 / £190 in big sales events.</p><p>That said, I would say that it&apos;s definitely worth waiting for the Nintendo Switch 2 if your biggest concern is graphical fidelity. The current console is capable of a lot, with some superb looking games such as <em>Splatoon 3 </em>or <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>showing what it can do, but it is almost gauranteed that software on its successor will look even better.</p><p>If you play lots of third-party games, then I would also say that it&apos;s worth waiting. Lots of recent third-party titles on Nintendo Switch have suffered from very poor performance, like <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>. If you intend to play games that weren&apos;t developed or published by Nintendo, then consider holding off until a beefier system is here.</p><p>Of course, you should also avoid the Nintendo Switch right now if you&apos;re the kind of person who simply has to own the latest and greatest version of a system. Based on everything we know, the Nintendo Switch 2 will almost certainly release in 2025 and that means you won&apos;t have that many months before needing to upgrade if you pick up a Nintendo Switch right now.<br></p>

                                <p>It&apos;s official, a successor to the Nintendo Switch will be announced before 31 March this year. The wait is on now that we have that announcement window, though there is still very little concrete information about the console itself.</p><p>The last hardware refresh that the Nintendo Switch received was with the launch of the Nintendo Switch OLED on October 8, 2021. Although the Nintendo Switch OLED boasts an enhanced OLED display, not to mention additional internal storage and improved speakers, there were no substantial upgrades to the power of the machine itself. This is a little problematic as, while the majority of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-nintendo-switch-games">best Nintendo Switch games</a> manage to run smoothly enough, the Nintendo Switch is still powered by a modest Nvidia Tegra X1 chip and just 4GB of RAM.</p><p>Third-party releases like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </em>and <em>Biomutant </em>have really started to push this hardware to its absolute limits, with unstable frame rates and greatly compromised visuals. Even in ideal situations, however, the console can only play games in up to 720p in handheld mode, while that number increases to just to 1080p when in docked mode. Now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a> have been on the market for a few years, both consoles that can play games at a smooth 60 fps and high-fidelity 4K resolution, not to mention the imminent arrival of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, it makes a lot of sense for Nintendo to take things back to the drawing board and improve its hardware to better keep up with the competition.</p><p>But what could be in store for Nintendo fans? Here are all the latest rumors, plus plenty of carefully considered speculation, about the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<ul><li><strong>What is it?</strong> The successor to the Nintendo Switch console</li><li><strong>How much will it cost? </strong>TBA</li><li><strong>When will it release? </strong>TBA, but an announcement has been confirmed for before the end of 2025</li><li><strong>What will its upgrades be? </strong>TBA, but more powerful hardware with improvements to RAM, CPU power, and GPU speed, is almost gauranteed.

<p>Although the Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, though Nintendo has confirmed that the announcement is coming within the fiscal year - which means before 31 March 2025. As for when this announcement will arrive, we certainly wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it lands in early 2025. It could really be any day now.</p><p>Based on the reveal and release timings of the original Nintendo Switch, it seems safe to assume that the console will then hit store shelves in 2025. This lines up with previous reports from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF196OV0Z10C24A2000000/" target="_blank">Japanese media outlet Nikkei</a> that suggest that the console is set to release in 2025.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch launched for $259.99 / £259.99 / AUD$435, with the newer Nintendo Switch OLED then available for $349.99 / £309.99 / AU$539.95. Given that the Nintendo Switch 2 will likely feature improved hardware compared to both of these models, the asking price is very likely to be higher than those figures.</p><p>For some additional perspective, the PS5 and Xbox Series X sell for $499.99 / £479.99 / AU$799.95 and $499 / £449 / AU$749 respectively. The more powerful PS5 Pro then costs a staggering $699.99 / £699.99 / AU$1,200.</p><p>Nintendo often aims to undercut its competition by offering lower spec hardware at a more affordable price. With this in mind, we wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the Nintendo Switch 2 is priced around $399.99 / £399.99 / AU$699.95 or even slightly lower to keep the competitive edge.</p><p>In short, expect something less expensive than an a PS5 and Xbox Series X, but more than the current Nintendo Switch. That said, you should bear in mind that this is purely an educated guess for the time being.</p>

<p>The most recent rumours regarding potential Nintendo Switch 2 specs come from a spec sheet created by the YouTube content creator Paul Eccleston or “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDiEVX1ZjXA" target="_blank">RedGamingTech</a>”. As explained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-could-be-disappointingly-underpowered-heres-what-we-know">Tom’s Hardware</a>, Eccleston supposedly made the spec sheet with information from his own sources and a report by the Korean United Daily News. This spec sheet suggests that the Nintendo Switch 2 will feature an eight core Cortex-A78AE processor, 8GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal eMMC storage.</p><p>While this is not particularly impressive compared to the PS5 or Xbox Series X, it would still represent an improvement in power compared to all of the current Nintendo Switch models.</p><p>That same source also indicates that the Nintendo Switch 2 could offer hugely improved battery life, in addition to a 120 Hz refresh rate with a 7-inch OLED display. In terms of overall design, Ecclestone says that it is likely to be similar to that of the Nintendo Switch OLED.</p><p>Interestingly, this contradicts older rumors that suggested we may see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/nintendo-switch-pro-could-sport-a-mini-led-display-heres-why-that-matters">mini-LED display</a> used for the screen. According to a report by Taiwan’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/4963550" target="_blank">Economic Daily News</a>, a Nintendo Switch successor could sport mini-LED screens supplied by Innolux.</p><p>Going back even further, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-new-revision-aula-4k/">Wccftech</a> reported that a data miner known as "SciresM" had claimed to have found a reference to a new Nintendo Switch model within the Nintendo Switch’s latest firmware update under the codename &apos;Aula&apos;. Rather than being within the Nintendo Switch itself, this source argues that the hardware improvement “might be inside a new dock and not inside the tablet". They do note, however, that "there’s no way to tell from the firmware code yet.”</p><p>We&apos;ve also seen some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-pro-rumor-looks-legit-thanks-to-this-nvidia-email">Nintendo Switch Pro rumors thanks to a leaked Nvidia</a> email which suggested the existence of the Tegra239 SoC (system on a chip).

NerdNest posted a video explaining that a third-party accessory manufacturer, iVoler, reached out to them with an offer to test a new case alongside a model of the unreleased device.</p><p>When comparing the size of the model to the original Switch, it&apos;s clear that the Switch 2 is bigger in scale and, after measuring, the YouTuber confirmed that the screen itself is "maybe 7.9 or maybe 8 inches, diagonal".</p><p><strong>Dbrand shows us what could be a 3D scan of the console</strong></p><p>Third-party accessory manufacturer Dbrand has given us an even more detailed look at the Switch 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-switch/to-the-surprise-of-absolutely-no-one-another-new-look-at-the-nintendo-switch-2-has-seemingly-leaked">revealing a 3D render</a> reportedly based on a 3D scan of the upcoming console.</p><p>According the this, the Switch 2 is larger and taller tahn the original model but has roughly the same thickness. This means it will measure 270mm wide, 116mm tall, and 14mm thick, compared to the Switch&apos;s measurements of 242mm x 102mm x 13.9mm.</p><p>The Dbrand CEO also stated that the Joy-Cons are magnetically attached, with an ejection button on the back in order to remove it.</p><p><strong>Accessory company may have revealed the first look</strong></p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-switch/new-nintendo-switch-2-leak-may-have-revealed-the-first-look-at-the-new-handheld">accessory manufacturer may have accidentally given us our first look at the Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

In the trailer we can see a blurry shot o the handheld, which may have been our very first look at it.</p><p>The design shown in the video lines up with previous leaks and rumors.

In an X / Twitter post, developer Playtonic confirmed that the game will be coming to "PS5, Xbox Series and... Nintendo" followed by a cheeky eye emoji. A plain Nintendo logo can also be seen at the end of the trailer alongside the other platforms, which is a noticeable departure from the usual Nintendo Switch emblem.

This year we&apos;re getting something a little different from the expected <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>package though, with a brand new Nintendo Switch OLED Super Mario Bros. Wonder bundle. It contains a Nintendo Switch OLED console, plus a copy of <em>Super Mario Bros.

There&apos;s no word on what this could be at the moment, but we do know that those interested must have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership to qualify. There&apos;s a slim chance that this might be something to do with the Nintendo Switch 2, potentially getting ready for its launch.</p><p><strong>Nintendo has finally released new hardware... but it&apos;s not the Switch 2</strong></p><p>In a surprising move, Nintendo revealed a brand-new piece of hardware.

It&apos;s a Nintendo-themed alarm clock, with internet connectivity and some unique body tracking features.

MST Financial senior analyst David Gibson commented on the efforts by Hosiden, one of Nintendo&apos;s primary hardware assembles, to increase spending on production equipment and automation "for its major customer in amusement" - likely to be Nintendo. Based on this information, Gibson said that he expects "Sept news and March 2025 release" for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 seems unlikely to arrive before April 2025</strong></p><p>According to reports, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-switch-2-to-launch-in-april-2025-at-the-earliest-according-to-reports">Nintendo Switch 2 will launch in April 2025 at the earliest</a>. This comes from Chris Dring, head of industry website GamesIndustry.biz, who has allegedly spoken to developers about the upcoming console. ""No developer I’ve spoken to expects it to be launching this financial year. In fact, they’ve been told not to expect it in the [current] financial year," he said. "A bunch of people I spoke to hope it’s out in April or May time, still early next year, not late."</p><p><strong>Nintendo has a simple plan to thwart Nintendo Switch 2 resellers</strong></p><p>Speaking at a Q&A during the company&apos;s 84th annual shareholder meeting, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa discussed some plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-has-a-plan-to-combat-potential-switch-2-resellers-simply-make-enough-of-its-next-console">combat potential Nintendo Switch 2 resellers</a>. He said that "as a countermeasure for resale, we believe that it is most important to produce a sufficient number to meet customer demand." Put simply, the idea is that if Nintendo manufactures enough Nintendo Switch 2 units, customers won&apos;t ever feel the need to purchase from resellers at a marked up price.</p><p>We will have to wait and see whether this strategy is effective, but this should still offer some reassurance to those who are worried about having to hunt down limited stock around the launch period.</p><p><strong>Final Fantasy 14 could come to the Nintendo Switch 2</strong></p><p>We might have had our first hint at one of the third-party games that could to the Nintendo Switch 2.

Interestingly, they provided some additional insight that was supposedly gleaned  through their NVIDIA contacts.

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-should-you-wait-for-the-nintendo-switch-2"><span>Should you wait for the Nintendo Switch 2?</span></h3>
<p>The question of whether you should wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 is something that&apos;s likely going to be on every gamer&apos;s mind in the lead up to the console&apos;s official reveal and subsequent release. As with a lot of things, however, the answer here really depends on your specific needs and what you want out of a console.</p><p>If you&apos;re just looking for a way to play the existing library of Nintendo Switch games, then the current Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch OLED, or Nintendo Switch Lite are going to be more than enough for you. Given that the console is quite old now, it&apos;s available pretty cheaply and is often part of generous bundles that pack-in a top game or two at no extra cost.</p><p>As the Nintendo Switch 2 will likely cost more than the existing Nintendo Switch, thanks to a combination of general price increases in plenty of consumer tech products over the years and the high likelihood of substantially improved hardware under the hood, Nintendo&apos;s current system is also a great choice if you&apos;re shopping on a budget. In this regard, the Nintendo Switch Lite is especially easy to recommend, as it has occasionally dropped to under $160 / £190 in big sales events.</p><p>That said, I would say that it&apos;s definitely worth waiting for the Nintendo Switch 2 if your biggest concern is graphical fidelity. The current console is capable of a lot, with some superb looking games such as <em>Splatoon 3 </em>or <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>showing what it can do, but it is almost gauranteed that software on its successor will look even better.</p><p>If you play lots of third-party games, then I would also say that it&apos;s worth waiting. Lots of recent third-party titles on Nintendo Switch have suffered from very poor performance, like <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>. If you intend to play games that weren&apos;t developed or published by Nintendo, then consider holding off until a beefier system is here.</p><p>Of course, you should also avoid the Nintendo Switch right now if you&apos;re the kind of person who simply has to own the latest and greatest version of a system. Based on everything we know, the Nintendo Switch 2 will almost certainly release in 2025 and that means you won&apos;t have that many months before needing to upgrade if you pick up a Nintendo Switch right now.<br></p>

<h2 id="the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-i-really-want-in-korea-and-china-only-2">The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold I really want… in Korea and China only?!</h2>
<p>Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6"><u>Galaxy Z Fold 6</u></a> has a flaw: Z Fold phones are simply too narrow when closed. The front screen looks awkward and some apps don’t fit right. I hoped Samsung would fix the problem with the Galaxy Z Fold 6, but the new phone was only a bit wider than previous Galaxys Z Fold. The problem persisted, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/oneplus-phones/oneplus-open-review"><u>OnePlus Open</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review"><u>Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</u></a> showed how a foldable tablet is supposed to look.</p><p>Then Samsung fixed the problem! It launched a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-phones/the-new-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-fixes-3-of-the-z-fold-6s-major-issues"><u>Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</u></a> with a bigger display up front and a proper aspect ratio. It also got a big 200-megapixel camera upgrade, but I don’t care about that because I forgive foldable phones for their camera foibles.</p><p>But wait, the new Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition phone is only on sale in Korea and China!? Okay, so those countries actually spend money on foldable phones. Sorry US, UK, and Australia readers, maybe if you’d just dropped a few grand on a Samsung foldable last year, you’d have the correct Galaxy Fold model this year. I hope the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/leaked-codenames-point-to-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-and-z-fold-se-2"><u>Galaxy Z Fold 7</u></a> doesn’t disappoint.</p>

<p>I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-iphone-16-got-a-camera-control-button-so-what-more-do-you-want"><u>very excited about the new Camera Control</u></a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-16-review"><u>iPhone 16</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-16-pro-review"><u>iPhone 16 Pro</u></a> models. I’ve been hoping two-stage shutter buttons would make a comeback (every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/best-windows-phone-which-should-you-buy-964329"><u>Windows Phone</u></a> had one!), because it makes shooting much easier when you want a steady focus and a sharper shot.</p><p>Then the Camera Control showed up and it was nothing like what we’d seen before. It was so much more than just a shutter button with focus lock. I really like the Control! And I love that every iPhone 16 model gets a Camera Control. I think there’s a lot of potential.</p><p>I just have one big problem: it doesn’t do the thing I wanted. I wanted a button that has a halfway stopping point – <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-iphone-16-pro-might-revive-my-favorite-nokia-feature-and-its-the-best-thing-ever"><u>a two-stage shutter that you can press</u></a> a little bit, then press harder. You can do that with the Camera Control, but there’s no real stopping point, you get haptic feedback from the iPhone when you get there. I’m not very good at stopping my finger at precisely the right point without some physical resistance.</p><p>Also, the focus lock feature wasn’t available at launch, it took a few months to arrive, and by the time it did, the Camera Control became known for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/apple-intelligence-explained">Apple Intelligence</a> powers more than its camera convenience. Maybe that was the point all along? Hopefully when Samsung inevitably copies this button, it will offer a proper two-stage shutter button like I wanted.</p>

<p>There’s a camera phone that haunts my dreams: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/xiaomi-phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review"><u>Xiaomi 14 Ultra</u></a>. It might be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-cameraphone">best camera phone</a> on the market right now, but not my market. You can get a Xiaomi phone in plenty of other English-speaking countries. But the US doesn’t have an official retail channel, and I wouldn’t buy an import model because I won’t get full network or warranty support.</p><p>So, I borrowed a Xiaomi 14 Ultra from our UK team, and its cameras are jaw-dropping. I took photos that were light years ahead of what some of our favorite US camera phones can produce, especially shooting macro photos, portraits, and enhanced zoom shots. The level of control is amazing, with the best aperture control I’ve seen on a smartphone.</p><p>I’ve never gotten a satisfying answer explaining why I can’t buy Xiaomi phones. For that matter, why can’t I buy any cool Huawei phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/huawei-phones/huawei-mate-xt-hands-on-review"><u>Huawei Mate XT</u></a>?!

<p>There are so many problems with generative AI that it’s tough to nail down my favorite bugbear. Is it rampant and blatant copyright infringement? Supervillainous levels of energy consumption? I think my favorite generative AI problem to whine about is the way AI image generators usually create images that adhere to racist, sexist, ableist… pretty much any stereotype you can imagine, and probably a few we haven’t defined.</p><p>That isn’t a bug, it’s a feature because of the way they were trained, and it’s now a feature on your smartphone. Google and Samsung have avoided the worst problems by limiting AI wallpaper features. But when I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/motorola-phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review"><u>Motorola Razr Plus 2024</u></a>, the results I got from the image generator presented a strong pattern of Antisemitic and misogynist stereotypes.

                                <p>In the spirit of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus">Festivus</a>, I am airing my grievances for the smartphone world. Gather round the Festivus pole! To paraphrase the impeccable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l8Eag9CAFk"><u>Frank Costanza, ‘I got a lotta problems with you phones, and now you're going to hear about it!’</u></a> While I’m sure there will be time later for the feats of strength benchmark tests, now I want to discuss the ways my loved ones have disappointed me over the past year.</p><p>You think I’m going to drone on and on about AI? Don’t worry, I’ll get to it. It will be a Festivus miracle when I finally see AI features that make a smartphone worth buying. I’d settle for AI that doesn’t tell me my son sold the family dog every time he texts updates about football practice.</p><p>These are my biggest problems with some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-phone">best phones</a> I saw this year, and just like I tell my own family, if I didn’t love these phones I wouldn’t spend so much time criticizing every way they aren’t perfect.</p>

<h2 id="the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-i-really-want-in-korea-and-china-only-6">The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold I really want… in Korea and China only?!</h2>
<p>Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6"><u>Galaxy Z Fold 6</u></a> has a flaw: Z Fold phones are simply too narrow when closed. The front screen looks awkward and some apps don’t fit right. I hoped Samsung would fix the problem with the Galaxy Z Fold 6, but the new phone was only a bit wider than previous Galaxys Z Fold. The problem persisted, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/oneplus-phones/oneplus-open-review"><u>OnePlus Open</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review"><u>Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</u></a> showed how a foldable tablet is supposed to look.</p><p>Then Samsung fixed the problem! It launched a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-phones/the-new-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-fixes-3-of-the-z-fold-6s-major-issues"><u>Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</u></a> with a bigger display up front and a proper aspect ratio. It also got a big 200-megapixel camera upgrade, but I don’t care about that because I forgive foldable phones for their camera foibles.</p><p>But wait, the new Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition phone is only on sale in Korea and China!? Okay, so those countries actually spend money on foldable phones. Sorry US, UK, and Australia readers, maybe if you’d just dropped a few grand on a Samsung foldable last year, you’d have the correct Galaxy Fold model this year. I hope the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/leaked-codenames-point-to-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-and-z-fold-se-2"><u>Galaxy Z Fold 7</u></a> doesn’t disappoint.</p>
<h2 id="the-iphone-16-camera-control-isn-t-a-shutter-button-6">The iPhone 16 Camera Control isn’t a shutter button</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iNcxnSdvGDd6WMufpxSXQR" name="iphone-16" alt="iPhone 16 Camera Control" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iNcxnSdvGDd6WMufpxSXQR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-iphone-16-got-a-camera-control-button-so-what-more-do-you-want"><u>very excited about the new Camera Control</u></a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-16-review"><u>iPhone 16</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-16-pro-review"><u>iPhone 16 Pro</u></a> models. I’ve been hoping two-stage shutter buttons would make a comeback (every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/best-windows-phone-which-should-you-buy-964329"><u>Windows Phone</u></a> had one!), because it makes shooting much easier when you want a steady focus and a sharper shot.</p><p>Then the Camera Control showed up and it was nothing like what we’d seen before. It was so much more than just a shutter button with focus lock. I really like the Control! And I love that every iPhone 16 model gets a Camera Control. I think there’s a lot of potential.</p><p>I just have one big problem: it doesn’t do the thing I wanted. I wanted a button that has a halfway stopping point – <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-iphone-16-pro-might-revive-my-favorite-nokia-feature-and-its-the-best-thing-ever"><u>a two-stage shutter that you can press</u></a> a little bit, then press harder. You can do that with the Camera Control, but there’s no real stopping point, you get haptic feedback from the iPhone when you get there. I’m not very good at stopping my finger at precisely the right point without some physical resistance.</p><p>Also, the focus lock feature wasn’t available at launch, it took a few months to arrive, and by the time it did, the Camera Control became known for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/apple-intelligence-explained">Apple Intelligence</a> powers more than its camera convenience. Maybe that was the point all along? Hopefully when Samsung inevitably copies this button, it will offer a proper two-stage shutter button like I wanted.</p>
<h2 id="i-can-t-buy-a-xiaomi-14-ultra-or-a-huawei-why-6">I can’t buy a Xiaomi 14 Ultra. Or a Huawei. Why?!</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="F9y65kXcNNtYauZcMiEdhS" name="Xiaomi 14 Ultra_15.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F9y65kXcNNtYauZcMiEdhS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s a camera phone that haunts my dreams: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/xiaomi-phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review"><u>Xiaomi 14 Ultra</u></a>. It might be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-cameraphone">best camera phone</a> on the market right now, but not my market. You can get a Xiaomi phone in plenty of other English-speaking countries. But the US doesn’t have an official retail channel, and I wouldn’t buy an import model because I won’t get full network or warranty support.</p><p>So, I borrowed a Xiaomi 14 Ultra from our UK team, and its cameras are jaw-dropping. I took photos that were light years ahead of what some of our favorite US camera phones can produce, especially shooting macro photos, portraits, and enhanced zoom shots. The level of control is amazing, with the best aperture control I’ve seen on a smartphone.</p><p>I’ve never gotten a satisfying answer explaining why I can’t buy Xiaomi phones. For that matter, why can’t I buy any cool Huawei phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/huawei-phones/huawei-mate-xt-hands-on-review"><u>Huawei Mate XT</u></a>?! I have heard from industry analysts that there is a political reason more than a technological impediment. In any case, it’s clear the US market is missing out on something good.</p>
<h2 id="stereotypes-from-generative-ai-now-on-your-smartphone-6">Stereotypes from generative AI, now on your smartphone</h2>

<p>There are so many problems with generative AI that it’s tough to nail down my favorite bugbear. Is it rampant and blatant copyright infringement? Supervillainous levels of energy consumption? I think my favorite generative AI problem to whine about is the way AI image generators usually create images that adhere to racist, sexist, ableist… pretty much any stereotype you can imagine, and probably a few we haven’t defined.</p><p>That isn’t a bug, it’s a feature because of the way they were trained, and it’s now a feature on your smartphone. Google and Samsung have avoided the worst problems by limiting AI wallpaper features. But when I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/motorola-phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review"><u>Motorola Razr Plus 2024</u></a>, the results I got from the image generator presented a strong pattern of Antisemitic and misogynist stereotypes. It was shocking.</p><p>This is not acceptable. These AI image generators are not useful enough to justify the danger. Why do I need a problematic wallpaper app on my phone? When did it become acceptable for electronics companies to foist offensive features on users? I’m guessing it’s when we decided we weren’t going to buy those foldable phones.</p><p>When AI works properly, I’ll be excited to use it. Until then, I don’t need it, just like I wouldn’t need a text messaging app that can’t send text messages, or a web browser that goes to the wrong URL. AI features don’t work, and that is the end of that.</p>

<hr>
<p>As a New Years Day gift, a Twitter user had posted details of a zero-day exploit in popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-file-compression-software">file compression software</a> 7-Zip - but its creator, Igor Pavlov, swiftly debunked it as an AI hoax.</p><p>“The common conclusion is that this fake exploit code from Twitter was generated by LLM (AI),” he began in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2539/">comments</a> on software repository Sourceforge.net (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/alleged-7-zip-arbitrary-code-execution-exploit-leaked-to-twitter-the-7-zip-author-claims-this-exploit-not-only-isnt-real-but-was-generated-by-ai"><em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a>).</p><p>Pavlov went on to suggest that the exploit code is, essentially, the product of an LLM hallucination - an AI making things up, which has become a common occurrence with AI’s rise in popularity.</p>
<h2 id="7-zip-exploit-code-hallucination-2">7-Zip exploit code hallucination</h2>
<p>"The comment in the "fake" code contains the statement: 'This exploit targets a vulnerability in the LZMA decoder of the 7-Zip software. It uses a crafted .7z archive with a malformed LZMA stream to trigger a buffer overflow condition in the RC_NORM function.'"</p><p>"But there is no RC_NORM function in [the] LZMA decoder. Instead, 7-Zip contains RC_NORM macro in LZMA encoder and PPMD decoder. Thus, the LZMA decoding code does not call RC_NORM. And the statement about RC_NORM in the exploit comment is not true."</p><p>We have no reason not to believe that what Pavlov is saying is true: 7-Zip is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-open-source-software">open source</a>, for starters, so anyone can verify his claims.</p><p>And while we’re not going to name the Twitter user responsible for spreading the rumour, or link to the tweet, we would say that it sounds like a craven attempt at attention-grabbing on the internet - inconceivable, we know - given that the user claims to be running a week-long reveal of software 0-days as a “thanks to all new followers.”</p><p>It seems like the stormiest teacup you could imagine, but maybe you’ll hear from us again in a week’s time.</p>

<hr>
<p>As a New Years Day gift, a Twitter user had posted details of a zero-day exploit in popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-file-compression-software">file compression software</a> 7-Zip - but its creator, Igor Pavlov, swiftly debunked it as an AI hoax.</p><p>“The common conclusion is that this fake exploit code from Twitter was generated by LLM (AI),” he began in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2539/">comments</a> on software repository Sourceforge.net (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/alleged-7-zip-arbitrary-code-execution-exploit-leaked-to-twitter-the-7-zip-author-claims-this-exploit-not-only-isnt-real-but-was-generated-by-ai"><em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a>).</p><p>Pavlov went on to suggest that the exploit code is, essentially, the product of an LLM hallucination - an AI making things up, which has become a common occurrence with AI’s rise in popularity.</p>
<h2 id="7-zip-exploit-code-hallucination-6">7-Zip exploit code hallucination</h2>
<p>"The comment in the "fake" code contains the statement: 'This exploit targets a vulnerability in the LZMA decoder of the 7-Zip software. It uses a crafted .7z archive with a malformed LZMA stream to trigger a buffer overflow condition in the RC_NORM function.'"</p><p>"But there is no RC_NORM function in [the] LZMA decoder. Instead, 7-Zip contains RC_NORM macro in LZMA encoder and PPMD decoder. Thus, the LZMA decoding code does not call RC_NORM. And the statement about RC_NORM in the exploit comment is not true."</p><p>We have no reason not to believe that what Pavlov is saying is true: 7-Zip is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-open-source-software">open source</a>, for starters, so anyone can verify his claims.</p><p>And while we’re not going to name the Twitter user responsible for spreading the rumour, or link to the tweet, we would say that it sounds like a craven attempt at attention-grabbing on the internet - inconceivable, we know - given that the user claims to be running a week-long reveal of software 0-days as a “thanks to all new followers.”</p><p>It seems like the stormiest teacup you could imagine, but maybe you’ll hear from us again in a week’s time.</p>

Indeed, the holidays didn't stop the world's biggest studios from releasing trailers for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/new-movies">new movies</a> and TV shows, or making other notable announcements ahead of New Year's Day.</p><p>We covered a couple of those reveals over the break, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/max-confirms-more-monster-mayhem-after-renewing-the-dc-animated-series-creature-commandos-for-season-2"><em>Creature Commandos </em>confirmed to be returning for a second<em> </em>season</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/no-subscription-needed-apple-tv-plus-will-be-free-for-everyone-this-weekend-ahead-of-severance-season-2-premiere">Apple TV Plus being free to watch this weekend</a> (January 4 and 5) chief among them. There were plenty more we didn't get to, though, so here are six other big entertainment news stories you may have missed during the so-called most wonderful time of the year.</p>
<h2 id="marvel-comes-out-swinging-with-your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-s-first-trailer-2">Marvel comes out swinging with Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man's first trailer</h2>

<p>After a largely successful 2024, Marvel will be hoping for another stellar year in 2025. The comic giant endured a torrid time throughout 2023, so the Disney subsidiary will have been delighted with last year's various success stories, such as the multi-billion dollar-making <em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em>.</p><p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/mcu">MCU</a>) will be going all-out to replicate those wins this year, too, starting with <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em> (<em>YFNSM</em>). An animated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/marvel-phase-5-every-mcu-movie-and-tv-show-release-date-for-2023-and-beyond">Marvel Phase 5</a> series that'll debut on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/disney-plus-movies-shows-free-trial-hamilton-and-more-explained">Disney Plus</a> on January 29, it reimagines the iconic webslinger's origins story, subsequent superhero adventures, and how he marries the latter with his high-school studies. With its modern take on Peter Parker and his wallcrawling alias, plus its comic-like, cel-shaded animation, <em>YFNSM</em> will aim to get 2025 off to a *ahem* spectacular start for Marvel.</p>

<p>The first of two big <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/dc">DC</a> Comics new stories that broke over the festive season, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techradar.com/tag/batman">Batman</a> fans were left disappointed by the revelation that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/the-batman-part-ii-hub"><em>The Batman</em> Part 2</a>'s launch date had been pushed back once more.</p><p>Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2024/12/the-batman-2-tom-cruise-warner-bros-mickey-17-sinners-release-dates-1236242822/" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, the highly-anticipated sequel, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/holy-smokes-bat-fans-the-batman-part-2-has-been-delayed-until-late-2026">originally delayed from October 2025 to October 2026</a> just 10 months ago, has seen its release postponed by another year. It'll now land in theaters on October 1, 2027. Defending the delay, DC Studios co-chief James Gunn said (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/DEF_ZMfyd7z" target="_blank">Threads</a>) that co-writer and director Matt Reeves wasn't happy with the movie's script, hence the decision to move its launch again.</p>

<p>If that Batman news was a source of disappointment, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/supergirl-woman-of-tomorrow"><em>Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow</em></a> announcement wasn't. Before 2024 ended, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2024/12/jason-momoa-to-play-lobo-supergirl-woman-of-tomorrow-1236243776/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> claimed Jason Momoa had been cast as Lobo in the forthcoming DC Cinematic Universe (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/dcu">DCU</a>) film, with Gunn and Momoa later confirming Deadline's report was true on social media.</p><p>An immortal mercenary who's also the sole survivor of an alien race known as the Czarnian, Lobo will be the second DC character that Momoa has played. He previously played Aquaman in the now defunct DC Extended Universe (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/dceu">DCEU</a>), portraying the Atlantean superhero in two solo movies and the DCEU's <em>Justice League</em> flick. He'll star opposite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> alumnus Millie Alcock, who'll play the titular Kryptonian in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/dcu-chapter-one">DCU Chapter One</a> project and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/supergirl">Supergirl</a>'s first big-screen adventure for over 40 years.</p>

With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/the-night-agent"><em>The Night Agent</em></a>'s first season raking in millions of views, we'd be amazed if its sophomore chapter doesn't do likewise.</p>

<p>It's almost time for the dojo doors to close for the last time. The third and final part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/cobra-kai-season-6-everything-we-know-so-far"><em>Cobra Kai </em>season 6</a>, which is the hit series' final installment, will arrive on Netflix on February 13. Part 3 will comprise the last five episodes of not only this season, but also the action comedy-drama as a whole.</p><p>Still, while this'll mark the end of <em>The Karate Kid</em>'s pseudo-TV sequel, it isn't the end for everyone involved in the show. Ralph Macchio is set to reprise his role as Danny LaRusso in the <em>Karate Kid: Legends </em>film, which arrives in theaters this May. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/cobra-kai"><em>Cobra Kai</em></a>'s showrunners also have ideas for potential spin-offs of the popular show, too.

<p>Netflix went all-out in the marketing stakes over the Christmas period. Indeed, as evidenced by the first trailer for upcoming TV original<em> Zero Day</em>, its pre-2025 announcements weren't reserved for hugely successful shows that we can't wait to return to our screens.</p><p>So, what's <em>Zero Day </em>about? For one, it'll star legendary actor Robert de Niro, who makes the leap to the small screen for the very first time. He'll play an ex-US president who's tasked with unraveling a mass conspiracy in the wake of a devastating cyber attack that threatens the heart of American democracy and sociopolitics. With a behind-the-scenes crew comprising veterans from hit series including <em>Homeland</em> and <em>Narcos</em> among others, <em>Zero Day</em> could be another early 2025 hit for the world's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-tv-streaming-service-cord-cutting-compare">best streaming service</a> when it's released on February 20.</p>

Indeed, the holidays didn't stop the world's biggest studios from releasing trailers for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/new-movies">new movies</a> and TV shows, or making other notable announcements ahead of New Year's Day.</p><p>We covered a couple of those reveals over the break, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/max-confirms-more-monster-mayhem-after-renewing-the-dc-animated-series-creature-commandos-for-season-2"><em>Creature Commandos </em>confirmed to be returning for a second<em> </em>season</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/no-subscription-needed-apple-tv-plus-will-be-free-for-everyone-this-weekend-ahead-of-severance-season-2-premiere">Apple TV Plus being free to watch this weekend</a> (January 4 and 5) chief among them. There were plenty more we didn't get to, though, so here are six other big entertainment news stories you may have missed during the so-called most wonderful time of the year.</p>
<h2 id="marvel-comes-out-swinging-with-your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-s-first-trailer-6">Marvel comes out swinging with Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man's first trailer</h2>

<p>After a largely successful 2024, Marvel will be hoping for another stellar year in 2025. The comic giant endured a torrid time throughout 2023, so the Disney subsidiary will have been delighted with last year's various success stories, such as the multi-billion dollar-making <em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em>.</p><p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/mcu">MCU</a>) will be going all-out to replicate those wins this year, too, starting with <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em> (<em>YFNSM</em>). An animated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/marvel-phase-5-every-mcu-movie-and-tv-show-release-date-for-2023-and-beyond">Marvel Phase 5</a> series that'll debut on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/disney-plus-movies-shows-free-trial-hamilton-and-more-explained">Disney Plus</a> on January 29, it reimagines the iconic webslinger's origins story, subsequent superhero adventures, and how he marries the latter with his high-school studies. With its modern take on Peter Parker and his wallcrawling alias, plus its comic-like, cel-shaded animation, <em>YFNSM</em> will aim to get 2025 off to a *ahem* spectacular start for Marvel.</p>

<p>The first of two big <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/dc">DC</a> Comics new stories that broke over the festive season, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techradar.com/tag/batman">Batman</a> fans were left disappointed by the revelation that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/the-batman-part-ii-hub"><em>The Batman</em> Part 2</a>'s launch date had been pushed back once more.</p><p>Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2024/12/the-batman-2-tom-cruise-warner-bros-mickey-17-sinners-release-dates-1236242822/" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, the highly-anticipated sequel, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/holy-smokes-bat-fans-the-batman-part-2-has-been-delayed-until-late-2026">originally delayed from October 2025 to October 2026</a> just 10 months ago, has seen its release postponed by another year. It'll now land in theaters on October 1, 2027. Defending the delay, DC Studios co-chief James Gunn said (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/DEF_ZMfyd7z" target="_blank">Threads</a>) that co-writer and director Matt Reeves wasn't happy with the movie's script, hence the decision to move its launch again.</p>

<p>If that Batman news was a source of disappointment, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/supergirl-woman-of-tomorrow"><em>Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow</em></a> announcement wasn't. Before 2024 ended, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2024/12/jason-momoa-to-play-lobo-supergirl-woman-of-tomorrow-1236243776/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> claimed Jason Momoa had been cast as Lobo in the forthcoming DC Cinematic Universe (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/dcu">DCU</a>) film, with Gunn and Momoa later confirming Deadline's report was true on social media.</p><p>An immortal mercenary who's also the sole survivor of an alien race known as the Czarnian, Lobo will be the second DC character that Momoa has played. He previously played Aquaman in the now defunct DC Extended Universe (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/dceu">DCEU</a>), portraying the Atlantean superhero in two solo movies and the DCEU's <em>Justice League</em> flick.

With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/the-night-agent"><em>The Night Agent</em></a>'s first season raking in millions of views, we'd be amazed if its sophomore chapter doesn't do likewise.</p>

<p>It's almost time for the dojo doors to close for the last time. The third and final part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/cobra-kai-season-6-everything-we-know-so-far"><em>Cobra Kai </em>season 6</a>, which is the hit series' final installment, will arrive on Netflix on February 13. Part 3 will comprise the last five episodes of not only this season, but also the action comedy-drama as a whole.</p><p>Still, while this'll mark the end of <em>The Karate Kid</em>'s pseudo-TV sequel, it isn't the end for everyone involved in the show. Ralph Macchio is set to reprise his role as Danny LaRusso in the <em>Karate Kid: Legends </em>film, which arrives in theaters this May. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/cobra-kai"><em>Cobra Kai</em></a>'s showrunners also have ideas for potential spin-offs of the popular show, too.

<p>Netflix went all-out in the marketing stakes over the Christmas period. Indeed, as evidenced by the first trailer for upcoming TV original<em> Zero Day</em>, its pre-2025 announcements weren't reserved for hugely successful shows that we can't wait to return to our screens.</p><p>So, what's <em>Zero Day </em>about? For one, it'll star legendary actor Robert de Niro, who makes the leap to the small screen for the very first time. He'll play an ex-US president who's tasked with unraveling a mass conspiracy in the wake of a devastating cyber attack that threatens the heart of American democracy and sociopolitics. With a behind-the-scenes crew comprising veterans from hit series including <em>Homeland</em> and <em>Narcos</em> among others, <em>Zero Day</em> could be another early 2025 hit for the world's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-tv-streaming-service-cord-cutting-compare">best streaming service</a> when it's released on February 20.</p>

<p>The US Department of Justice has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-issues-final-rule-addressing-threat-posed-foreign-adversaries-access" target="_blank">issued a final rule</a> on Executive Order 14117, which President Joe Biden signed in February 2024, preventing the movement of US citizens’ data to a number of “countries of concern”.</p><p>The list of countries consists of China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Venezuela, all of which the DoJ says have “engaged in a long-term pattern or serious instances of conduct significantly adverse to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of U.S. persons.”</p><p>It added these nations could, “access and exploit Americans’ bulk sensitive personal data and certain U.S. Government-related data.”</p>
<h2 id="no-us-data-for-hostile-nations-2">No US data for hostile nations</h2>
<p>The final rule will come into effect in 90 days, with Assistant Attorney General Matthew G.

Companies that violate the order will face civil and criminal penalties. The types of prohibited data are:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Certain covered personal identifiers (e.g., names linked to device identifiers, social security numbers, driver’s license, or other government identification numbers)</li><li>Precise geolocation data (e.g., GPS coordinates)</li><li>Biometric identifiers (e.g., facial images, voice prints and patterns, and retina scans)</li><li>Human genomic data and three other types of human ‘omic data (epigenomic, proteomic, or transcriptomic)</li><li>Personal health data (e.g., height, weight, vital signs, symptoms, test results, diagnosis, digital dental records, and psychological diagnostics)</li><li>Personal financial data (e.g., information related to an individual’s credit, debit cards, bank accounts, and financial liabilities, including payment history)</li></ol>
<p>The DoJ also outlined the final rule does not apply to “medical, health, or science research or the development and marketing of new drugs” and “also does not broadly prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in commercial transactions, including exchanging financial and other data as part of the sale of commercial goods and services with countries of concern or covered persons, or impose measures aimed at a broader decoupling of the substantial consumer, economic, scientific, and trade relationships that the United States has with other countries.”<br><br>Via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/new-us-doj-rule-halts-bulk-data.html"><em>The Hacker News</em></a></p>
