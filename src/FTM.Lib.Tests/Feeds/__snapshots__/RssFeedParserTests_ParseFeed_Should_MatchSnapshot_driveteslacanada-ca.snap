      "Content": "\n<p><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lotus-unveils-the-2024-emeya-electric-hypercar/\">Lotus</a>, the Geely-owned British luxury carmaker, has announced a significant pivot away from its ambitious plan to become an all-electric brand by 2028. Instead, it will focus on developing &#x201C;Super Hybrid&#x201D; technology that combines a turbocharged combustion engine with advanced electric systems, catering to the preferences of high-end consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision was announced by Lotus CEO Feng Qingfeng at the Guangzhou Motor Show. While electric vehicles (EVs) have made strides in the mainstream market, luxury car buyers have proven slower to adopt, according to Qingfeng. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Luxury car engines are already very powerful, and the driving experience is quite similar, with eight-cylinder and 12-cylinder engines performing well,&#x201D; Qingfeng explained. These factors, coupled with slower sales growth in the premium EV segment, have steered Lotus back toward hybrids.<em> (via <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/lotus-embraces-erev-hybrids-it-axes-all-electric-plan\">Autocar</a></em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lotus&#8217;s new strategy will instead focus on the development of its &#x201C;Super Hybrid&#x201D; powertrains. These extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) aim to address common limitations of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) while offering an alternative to pure EVs. The system will pair a turbocharged combustion engine with a high-voltage, ultra-fast charging battery architecture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Lotus, this combination will deliver an impressive range of up to 680 miles (1,094km), with battery recharge times faster than traditional EV charging or even battery-swapping systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lotus plans to achieve this through a 900-volt electrical system, allowing for rapid &#x201C;flash-charging.&#x201D; The goal is to eliminate the sluggishness often associated with EREVs when the battery is depleted, ensuring a seamless driving experience even under extended use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The switch to hybrid technology is not just about consumer preferences&#x2014;it is also a tactical decision influenced by global trade dynamics. By incorporating internal combustion engines (ICEs) into its vehicles, Lotus can sidestep hefty tariffs imposed on Chinese-made EVs in the European Union. With its manufacturing base in China, this shift offers significant cost advantages while enabling the brand to maintain its presence in key markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China&#x2019;s surging demand for PHEVs and EREVs has also played a role in Lotus&#x2019;s strategic pivot. The Chinese market accounted for 25% of the brand&#x2019;s sales in the first 10 months of 2024, second only to Europe. As competitors like Zeekr, another Geely-owned brand, enter the PHEV space, Lotus is positioning itself to capitalize on this growing segment.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lotus-shifts-gears-and-returns-to-hybrids-over-all-electric-future/\">Lotus Shifts Gears and Returns to Hybrids Over All-Electric Future</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

      "Content": "\n<p>Tesla&#x2019;s Trip Planner has received a significant overhaul with a substantial rewrite of the software&#8217;s backend, resulting in more accurate predictions and unlocking new features that make road-tripping even easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, Tesla owners have relied on the Trip Planner to optimize routes, estimate battery usage, and locate charging stations. However, environmental factors such as wind, speed variations, and terrain occasionally caused discrepancies in arrival state-of-charge (SoC) predictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this recent update, which appears to have come with the release of software update 2024.33.35, also known as FSD v12.5.6.3, Tesla has refined the algorithms powering the Trip Planner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a report from <a href=\"https://x.com/DBurkland/status/1859608460280635707\">Dan Burkland</a> on X,  who frequently takes long trips in challenging conditions in the midwestern US, the updates have given Trip Planner remarkable improvement in prediction accuracy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burkland says the Trip Planner estimated their arrival SoC within a single percentage point, even while driving 9 mph above the speed limit&#x2014;a notable difference compared to past experiences where estimates could deviate by as much as 10%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These updates were <a href=\"https://x.com/wmorrill3/status/1859973772163563630\">confirmed </a>by Cybertruck lead engineer, Wes Morrill, who also revealed the rewrite unlocks additional functionality for Tesla owners. One of these is the ability to set a desired arrival SoC. This allows users to customize their trip planning experience by specifying how much battery charge they want upon reaching their destination. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a road trip to a remote location can now be planned with a buffer charge in mind, or drivers can prioritize faster charging stops or aim to maximize efficiency based on their specific needs.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-improves-trip-planner-with-backend-rewrite-and-new-feature/\">Tesla improves Trip Planner with backend rewrite and new feature</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

This compares to ASS in North America, which can operate when the owner is about 100 meters (328 feet) away, and which can travel that same distance.</p>\n<p>Combined, these limitations make ASS almost unusable for European users.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ass-tweets.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"97915\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-releases-neutered-version-of-actually-smart-summon-in-europe-and-the-middle-east/attachment/ass-tweets/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ass-tweets.jpg?fit=1125%2C783&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1125,783\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ass-tweets\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ass-tweets.jpg?fit=300%2C209&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ass-tweets.jpg?fit=975%2C679&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-97915\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ass-tweets.jpg?resize=975%2C679&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"975\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ass-tweets.jpg?w=1125&amp;ssl=1 1125w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ass-tweets.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ass-tweets.jpg?resize=1024%2C713&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ass-tweets.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Despite the current limitations, the introduction of ASS in Europe and the Middle East is a step forward.

Tesla has said it <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-shares-fsd-development-roadmap-key-updates-and-international-expansion/\">plans to bring its FSD feature to Europe (and China) in early 2025</a>.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) also contributed, with a 12.4% boost in volume. These gains came despite an overall 6.8% decline in light-duty vehicle registrations, underscoring the growth of the ZEV market in an otherwise declining automotive market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the provinces, Quebec maintained its leadership, with 34.6% of new vehicle registrations being ZEVs&#x2014;a dramatic rise from 28.4% in Q2. British Columbia followed at 24.9%, while Ontario reached 9.0%, reflecting steady progress. In Atlantic Canada, Prince Edward Island led with a 9.6% adoption rate, while Alberta and Manitoba achieved 5.6% and 6.3%, respectively. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"97903\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/zero-emission-vehicles-hit-1-in-6-new-vehicle-registrations-in-q3-2024/attachment/provinces/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/provinces.jpg?fit=1126%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1126,553\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"provinces\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/provinces.jpg?fit=300%2C147&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/provinces.jpg?fit=975%2C479&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"975\" height=\"479\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/provinces.jpg?resize=975%2C479&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97903\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/provinces.jpg?resize=1024%2C503&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/provinces.jpg?resize=300%2C147&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/provinces.jpg?resize=768%2C377&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/provinces.jpg?w=1126&amp;ssl=1 1126w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: S&amp;P Global Mobility</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-key-drivers-of-growth\">Key Drivers of Growth</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>S&amp;P Global says the increase in ZEV registrations is attributed to several factors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Government Incentives: Provincial and federal programs have played a significant role in making ZEVs more affordable. In Quebec, models like the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV benefited from combined rebates of up to $12,000.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Expanding Charging Infrastructure: Provinces with robust charging networks, like British Columbia and Quebec, have seen higher adoption rates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Technological Advancements and Pricing: Manufacturers are introducing competitive models at lower price points. For instance, the Chevrolet Equinox EV has gained popularity with its affordability and incentives.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-leading-manufacturers\">Leading Manufacturers</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla remained the dominant player in the Canadian ZEV market, with a 15.2% increase in sales from Q2, driven by high demand for the Model Y and Model 3. Chevrolet&#x2019;s ZEV sales surged by 138.0%, thanks to the Bolt EV and EUV, while Toyota experienced a 72.2% rise due to its Prius Prime and RAV4 Prime. Hyundai, Mercedes, and emerging players like <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/vinfasts-global-delivery-jumped-444-year-on-year-in-q1-2024/\">VinFast</a>, which saw a 66.52% increase, also contributed to the market&#x2019;s growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-challenges-and-future-outlook\">Challenges and Future Outlook</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While Q3 2024 showcased promising growth, challenges remain. S&amp;P Global notes the pace of charging infrastructure development, economic factors, and potential changes in government policies could influence future adoption rates. Nonetheless, forecasts are optimistic. ZEVs are expected to account for 19.0% of vehicle sales in 2025, rising to 30.7% by 2027. These projections reflect Canada&#x2019;s commitment to meeting climate goals and transitioning to a cleaner transportation system.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/zero-emission-vehicles-hit-1-in-6-new-vehicle-registrations-in-q3-2024/\">Zero-Emission Vehicles Hit 1 in 6 New Canadian Vehicle Registrations in Q3 2024</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

These temporary installations are typically set up in high-traffic areas such as shopping malls and popular public spaces, allowing Tesla to reach a broader audience without the long-term commitments associated with permanent retail locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla&#8217;s engagement with pop-up stores dates back many years. In 2016, the company launched a series of mobile galleries under the &#8220;Tesla Explores&#8221; program, featuring a <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-launches-new-model-x-y-platform-hitch-rack/\">Model X</a> towing an Airstream trailer outfitted as a mobile Design Studio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This program toured various cities across the United States, including New York City and Santa Barbara, providing interactive experiences and test drives to potential customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, Tesla expanded its pop-up presence by opening temporary stores in vacation destinations and upscale shopping centers. These locations were designed to attract tourists and shoppers, offering them the chance to learn about Tesla&#8217;s vehicles and energy products in a relaxed, informal setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Zhai, a member of Tesla&#8217;s Concepts &amp; Prototypes team, recently announced on LinkedIn that the company is bringing back its pop-up stores this holiday season to prominent shopping centers across the US. Among the malls mentioned by Zhai include American Dream in New Jersey, Virginia Beach, Southcenter in Washington, and one of the largest malls in the US, King of Prussia in Pennsylvania, with additional malls also getting pop-up stores.<em> (h/t: <a href=\"https://x.com/SERobinsonJr\">@SERobinsonJr</a>)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7265014065322672129\" height=\"571\" width=\"504\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Embedded post\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla&#8217;s pop-up store model offers key advantages, including flexibility to test new markets and gather feedback without the costs of permanent locations.

class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Kia</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 Kia EV6 introduces a significant enhancement by incorporating the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/kia-ev6-will-become-companys-first-car-to-receive-teslas-nacs-connector/\">North American Charging Standard (NACS) port</a>, aligning with the industry&#8217;s shift towards a unified charging interface. This integration facilitates direct access to Tesla&#8217;s extensive Supercharger network, eliminating the need for adapters and simplifying the charging process for EV6 owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the port upgrade, Kia has repositioned the charging port to the left rear fender on non-GT models. This strategic relocation aligns with the design of Tesla vehicles, ensuring compatibility with Supercharger station layouts and facilitating easier access during charging sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2025, the EV6 offers two larger battery options: a 63.0 kWh pack for the base model and an 84.0 kWh pack for higher trims. This increase translates to a targeted range of up to 319 miles (513km) in rear-wheel-drive configurations for the Light Long Range, Wind, and GT-Line trims. The powertrain lineup remains robust, with rear-wheel-drive models delivering up to 225 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, while dual-motor all-wheel-drive configurations produce 320 horsepower and 446 lb-ft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The high-performance EV6 GT receives a notable power boost, now producing up to 641 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque in GT mode. Additionally, the GT introduces a &#x201C;Virtual Gear Shift&#x201D; feature that mimics traditional gear changes through motor torque adjustments and sound effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kia&#x2019;s next-generation Connected Car Navigation Cockpit (ccNC) powers the 2025 EV6, enabling over-the-air (OTA) updates and advanced digital features. The vehicle offers a range of customizable add-ons through the Kia Connect Store, including music and video streaming, gaming, and a Wi-Fi hotspot. Enhanced convenience features such as Digital Key 2.0 allow users to unlock, start, and drive the EV6 with a smartphone or NFC-enabled card, even sharing access via text.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

Tesla also has four Service and Delivery Centers scattered across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"97870\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-lands-flagship-showroom-in-israel/attachment/israel/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/israel.jpg?fit=1040%2C587&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1040,587\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"israel\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/israel.jpg?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/israel.jpg?fit=975%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"975\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/israel.jpg?resize=975%2C550&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97870\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/israel.jpg?resize=1024%2C578&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/israel.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/israel.jpg?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/israel.jpg?w=1040&amp;ssl=1 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Tesla</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its launch in 2021, Tesla has quickly become a popular choice in Israel. In a little over one year the company <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-delivers-10000th-car-israel-two-new-records/\">delivered over 10,000 new cars to customers</a>. The debut of Tesla in Israel helped grow electric vehicle (EV) sales in the country <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-boost-electric-vehicle-sales-israel/\">by more than 700%</a>, giving Tesla more than <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/model-3/tesla-boosts-ev-sales-in-israel-528-securing-over-60-market-share/\">60% market share</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-lands-flagship-showroom-in-israel/\">Tesla Lands Flagship Showroom in Israel</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

      "Content": "\n<p><a href=\"http://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/tesla\">Tesla</a> has started handing out more 30-day trials of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) in North America, giving owners the opportunity to test out the self-driving technology before buying or subscribing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new trials started going out to owners on Wednesday evening. We received it on our 2022 Model Y last night immediately after installing the latest 2024.44.3 software update. Since our Model Y is HW3/AI3, we received FSD v12.5.4.2, the most recent version for cars without HW4/AI4, who are currently on FSD v12.5.6.2 with the end-to-end network used for both city and highway driving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trial is good for 30 days, so for us it will be expiring on December 20, 2024. So far it appears the trials are being granted to owners in both Canada and the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla most recently<a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-extends-fsd-trials-by-30-days/\"> gave out free FSD trials just last month</a> in October. A few weeks later many of those owners who received the trial also got an extension, suggesting that Tesla was still hoping to release FSD v13 during the trial window (it was originally expected in October). However, that has been <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-shares-updated-fsd-development-roadmap-with-focus-on-hw4-ai4/\">pushed back to the end of November</a>, and only for HW4/AI4 cars.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that we did not receive a trial last month, so it is unclear if those <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-extends-fsd-trials-by-30-days/\">trials will be extended</a> again by another 30 days into December. If this happens for you, let us know in the comments below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla first <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-launches-free-fsd-trials-for-new-buyers-in-north-america/\">started FSD trials earlier this year</a>, limiting them to new buyers only, before expanding the program to include existing owners.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">BREAKING: Tesla is again providing free 30 day FSD trails to owners.
