The pilot project, which aims to address persistent delays in the rollout of high-speed broadband under the European Union-funded Recovery Plan, will Starlink&#8217;s satellite internet as a complementary solution to traditional fiber-optic networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Italy&#x2019;s ambitious high-speed internet plan, supported by a &#x20AC;3.4 billion (C$5.08/US$3.6 billion) EU investment, aims to provide 1 gigabit-per-second download speeds to 3.4 million buildings across the country. However, progress has been slow. By mid-2024, state-backed fiber-optic firms Open Fiber and FiberCop have completed only a third of the cabling work, with much of the delay linked to the challenge of connecting 450,000 buildings in remote and sparsely populated areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the June 2026 deadline looming, the Italian government, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, is turning to Elon Musk&#8217;s Starlink to ensure timely completion of the broadband rollout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starlink currently has approximately 55,000 customers in Italy, according to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italy-test-starlink-january-bid-boost-high-speed-internet-sources-say-2024-12-09/\"><em>Reuters</em></a>. The pilot project, beginning in January, will test the feasibility of integrating satellite connectivity with Italy&#x2019;s fiber-optic networks. Results are expected as early as March 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, challenges remain, as Starlink did not meet Italy&#8217;s gigabit-per-second speed requirement during the 2021 broadband tender process. The pilot project will determine whether the technology has since advanced to meet these demands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inclusion of Starlink in Italy&#x2019;s broadband strategy has raised regulatory concerns from competitors. The telecom lobby group Asstel, representing local operators like Telecom Italia, Iliad, and Fastweb, is advocating for a level playing field. The group is calling for satellite broadband providers to adhere to the same data security and local storage regulations as traditional telcos.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/italy-to-trial-starlink-for-high-speed-internet-expansion/\">Italy to Trial Starlink for High-Speed Internet Expansion</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

      "Content": "\n<p>Tesla&#8217;s humanoid robot, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-demonstrates-upgraded-optimus-hand-catching-a-tennis-ball/\">Optimus</a>, is tackling new ground, literally, in its latest video release. In a new video released on Monday, Tesla showcased Optimus skillfully traversing uneven and hilly terrain, highlighting a major leap in its ability to handle real-world challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far we have only seen Optimus walking in interior offices and warehouses, both of which are flat and relatively easy to walk through. However, Tesla has taken it to a new level, showing Optimus walking outside on hilly, mulched ground&#x2014;an environment prone to instability, where even humans can struggle to maintain footing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla revealed that during these runs, Optimus operated without the assistance of video input, relying solely on other onboard sensors. These sensors feed data into a neural network running on Optimus&#8217;s embedded computer, which processes information in an astonishingly short time frame of approximately 2&#x2013;3 milliseconds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach enables the robot to maintain its balance dynamically, even in challenging environments. In one instance, Optimus did lose its footing and nearly fell to the ground, but with its quick reflexes, was able to regain its balance and continue walking down the slope.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Daily walks help clear your mind <a href=\"https://t.co/dUsW58trS6\">pic.twitter.com/dUsW58trS6</a></p>&mdash; Tesla Optimus (@Tesla_Optimus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tesla_Optimus/status/1866171391156113740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p>While this video showcased some tremendous advancements in Optimus&#8217; walking abilities, Tesla&#x2019;s AI team is not stopping there and is actively working on several key upgrades to the humanoid robot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Optimus engineer <a href=\"https://x.com/_milankovac_/status/1866181640147652980\">Milan Kovac</a>, one key area of development is incorporating vision capabilities. While the current demonstration highlights Optimus navigating terrain &#8220;blind,&#8221; future iterations will leverage visual input to plan movements more effectively, allowing the robot to adapt seamlessly to a variety of environments, significantly improving its situational awareness and decision-making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to vision, Tesla is refining Optimus&#8217;s movement mechanics to achieve a more fluid and natural gait, even on challenging terrain. Engineers are also focused on optimizing the robot&#8217;s responsiveness to changes in velocity and directional commands, ensuring it can react quickly and accurately in dynamic settings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another critical area of progress is developing strategies for safe recovery from falls. The team is working on teaching Optimus how to minimize damage during unavoidable tumbles and enabling it to stand back up independently, a vital feature for its long-term functionality and durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development team is expanding and actively recruiting talent across multiple tracks, including robotics-specific reinforcement learning, 3D understanding, and foundational AI models. This ambitious hiring push reflects Tesla&#8217;s vision of making Optimus a common tool in industries and households alike.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-optimus-robot-takes-on-uneven-terrain-in-impressive-new-video/\">Tesla&#8217;s Optimus Robot Takes on Uneven Terrain in Impressive New Video</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

During that call it was reportedly said the Model Q&#xA0;will debut with a base price under $30,000 (C$42,300) in the United States after subsidies, with a potential starting price as low as $25,000 (C$35,300). In China, local production could push prices even lower, with estimates suggesting a starting price of approximately <em>&#xA5;</em>140,000 (C$27,200/US$19,200). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report goes on to state that the Model Q, known internally as &#8220;Redwood,&#8221; will be built on Tesla&#8217;s next-generation platform, offering significant improvements in efficiency and affordability. The vehicle will be 15% smaller and 30% lighter than the Model 3, with an overall length of approximately 3,988 mm, making it Tesla&#8217;s most compact car yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For comparison, the Model 3 has a length of 4,694&#xA0;mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the manufacturing side, costs are expected to be roughly half those of the Model 3, thanks to advancements in production techniques and materials. The vehicle will utilize a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery, available in two configurations, 53 kWh and 75 kWh, supporting both single and dual-motor (RWD and AWD) variants. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This setup will deliver an estimated range of 500 kilometers (310 miles) of range, a notable figure at this price point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the report is accurate, which given the complexity of the details provided in it could very well be accurate, the Model Q is likely one of the two more affordable models <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-reaffirms-launch-of-affordable-models-in-early-2025/\">Tesla has already promised to release in 2025</a>. According to Tesla&#8217;s most recent update on these new vehicles, which came in the Q3 2024 shareholder deck, they will be built around its current vehicle platforms and the next-generation platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This strategy will enable the company to produce these vehicles on the same production lines as its current models, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs, which would ultimately allow for a more competitive price point.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-preparing-for-sub-30000-model-q-launch-in-h1-2025-report/\">Tesla preparing for sub-$30,000 Model Q launch in H1 2025: Report</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

On Saturday, November 30, the Supercharger network in the United States and Canada delivered an astounding 12 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity in just one day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The consumption figure was shared by Tesla&#8217;s Supercharging Director, Max de Zegher on X.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yes! 12 GWh on Saturday 11/30 on the North American network.</p>&mdash; Max de Zegher (@MdeZegher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MdeZegher/status/1865587398585004494?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p>To put this milestone into perspective, 12 GWh is enough energy to charge over 300,000 Tesla vehicles, assuming an average battery size of 60 kWh and only charging from 20%-80%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put another perspective on just how much energy was consumed in a single day, we only have to look at a stat published by Tesla after publishing its Q3 2024 results. According to the company, its global Supercharger network <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-supercharger-network-delivers-1-4-twh-in-q3-driving-annual-revenue-potential-beyond-2-5-billion/\">delivered 1.4 terawatt-hours (TWh)</a>, or 1,400 GWh, of electricity during the third quarter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That averages out to around 15-16 GWh of electric served out daily by Tesla&#8217;s Superchargers around the world, which compares to the 12 GWh delivered by just those in the US and Canada. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This metric also gives a good perspective on how much the Supercharger network has grown in recent years. Just over five years ago Tesla announced the network delivered 72 GWh of electricity in July 2019, averaging approximately 2.4 GWh per day. On November 30, the network delivered six times that amount, and only in North America.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Last month we had over 2 million Supercharger sessions, totalling 72 GWh of energy.<br><br>That could power:<br>&#8211; Hawaii for three days<br>&#8211; the Republic of Ireland for a day<br>&#8211; playing &#39;You&#39;re Beautiful&#39; on repeat from every device in your house because Karen just left you</p>&mdash; Tesla (@Tesla) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1165707219872231427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 25, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p>Statistics aside, the huge energy consumption figure points to another important aspect of the Supercharger network &#8211; its reliability. Despite the high demand during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, the Supercharger network successfully handled a massive volume of energy transactions without major disruptions. Tesla says its<a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-supercharger-network-monitoring-tool-allows-for-near-perfect-up-time/\"> Supercharger network has an uptime of 99.95%</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-north-american-supercharger-network-delivers-12-gwh-of-electricity-in-a-single-day/\">Tesla’s North American Supercharger network delivers 12 GWh of electricity in a single day</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

However, this trial is currently limited to crew members and operational needs, leaving passengers still without onboard internet access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BC Ferries first introduced Wi-Fi on its major routes 2010. Initially, the service was met with enthusiasm, offering passengers connectivity during their journeys. However, as more passengers began using the service, the system quickly showed its limitations, leading to the service being pulled from all vessels in July 2021 due to frequent customer complaints of slow speed and frequent outages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the rise of <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/spacex-introduces-tiers-starlink-maritime-service/\">Starlink Maritime</a>, <em>Drive Tesla</em> reached out to BC Ferries in April 2023 about the possibility of integrating Starlink technology on its vessels, but the Crown Corporation seemed unaware of the benefits, saying it wouldn&#8217;t work in the northern latitudes that its vessels travel, despite cruise ships with several thousands of passengers travelling further north than any BC Ferries route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Airlines connect via satellite or ground-based cellular and some charge customers for this service. This will not support the 900 users we see on our largest vessels. Cruise ships also use satellite which is easily accessible closer to the equator. The satellites available at our high northern latitudes are limited and would still not provide an adequate service for the number of users,&#8221; BC Ferries said in a statement to<em> Drive Tesla</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over a year later and BC Ferries has had a change of heart, with spokesperson Sheila Reynolds confirming on Friday they are testing Starlink on a select number of vessels. Currently the service is limited to enhancing crew operations only. Depending on how the testing goes, it may be expanded to passengers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s still too soon to determine its long-term viability for further expansion,&#x201D; Reynolds said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking at a recent Greater Vancouver Board of Trade event on Thursday, BC Ferries CEO Nicolas Jimenez emphasized the complexity of scaling the service from crews to passengers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Providing Wi-Fi for a crew of 30 or 40 is vastly different from delivering stable internet to over 1,400 passengers per vessel,&#x201D; Jimenez said. (via <a href=\"https://cheknews.ca/bc-ferries-partnering-with-elon-musks-starlink-to-provide-crews-with-wi-fi-1227755/\">Chek News</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, passengers should not expect an immediate return of onboard Wi-Fi. Jimenez noted that the company aims to &#x201C;mature the relationship with Starlink&#x201D; and explore solutions that balance affordability with technological capabilities. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/bc-ferries-tests-starlink-for-crew-but-passengers-will-have-to-wait/\">BC Ferries tests Starlink for crew, but passengers will have to wait</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

      "Content": "\n<p><a href=\"http://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/tesla\">Tesla </a>sent out an email to customers this morning with tips on how to stay safe and get the most out of your Tesla this upcoming winter season. In case you didn&#8217;t get the email, here are Tesla&#8217;s top winter driving tips.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-optimize-energy-usage-in-cold-weather\"><strong>Optimize Energy Usage in Cold Weather</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla vehicles use additional energy during winter to combat increased tire drag and to keep the cabin and battery warm. This is normal, but there are steps you can take to manage energy consumption effectively:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Precondition Before Driving:</strong> Use the Tesla app to preheat the cabin, which also preheats the battery. Activating preconditioning while the vehicle is plugged in ensures the energy comes from an external power source, preserving your battery&#x2019;s range.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Utilize Scheduled Departure:</strong> Set your departure time via the touchscreen or the Tesla app. Your Tesla will prepare itself by charging and preconditioning at the optimal times, ensuring peak efficiency from the moment you unplug.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-enhance-comfort-and-convenience\"><strong>Enhance Comfort and Convenience</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cold mornings don&#x2019;t have to mean chilly starts. Tesla offers several features to make your winter drives more comfortable:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Defrost From Anywhere:</strong> Use the Defrost feature in the Tesla app to clear snow and ice before heading outside.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adjust Mirrors and Wipers:</strong> If snow or ice is expected, place wipers in service mode and deactivate mirror auto-fold to prevent freezing. Both of these features are only accessible from the in-car display.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-drive-smarter-with-tesla-technology\"><strong>Drive Smarter with Tesla Technology</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter roads can be unpredictable, but Tesla&#x2019;s advanced technology helps you adapt to the conditions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Monitor Energy Consumption:</strong> The Energy app on your touchscreen tracks real-time and projected energy use, offering tips to improve efficiency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Plan Ahead with Navigation:</strong> When traveling to a Supercharger, navigate through the Tesla system to activate battery preheating, which improves charging speed and efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-prepare-for-snow-and-ice\"><strong>Prepare for Snow and Ice</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Snowy and icy conditions require extra precautions to protect your vehicle and ensure a safe journey:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clear Surfaces:</strong> Always remove snow from the hood, roof, and tailgate to prevent hazards for you and other drivers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Handle Frozen Components:</strong> If door handles, mirrors, or windows are frozen, use the Tesla app to activate the Defrost feature or gently clear ice manually.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-invest-in-winter-accessories\"><strong>Invest in Winter Accessories</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who regularly encounter snowy or icy roads, Tesla offers accessories to enhance winter driving performance:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Winter Tires and Snow Chains:</strong> Improve traction and safety with winter tires or snow chains, available through Tesla&#x2019;s shop.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Protect Your Paint:</strong> Install mud flaps and paint protection film to shield your vehicle from salt, debris, and harsh winter conditions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cold-Weather Washer Fluid:</strong> Regularly top off with de-icing washer fluid to keep your windshield clear.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-keep-an-eye-on-the-snowflake-icon\"><strong>Keep an Eye on the Snowflake Icon</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If a <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/model-3/what-does-the-snowflake-and-blue-battery-mean-on-my-tesla/\">blue snowflake appears</a> on your touchscreen or on your mobile app, it means the battery is too cold. A portion of your battery icon will also turn blue. This portion of your battery will be unusable, reducing your range, until the battery warms up. Driving, charging, and preconditioning will warm the battery and restore full functionality.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2053\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/model-3/what-does-the-snowflake-and-blue-battery-mean-on-my-tesla/attachment/tesla-blue-battery-with-snowflake-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tesla-blue-battery-with-snowflake-1.png?fit=479%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"479,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Tesla blue battery with snowflake\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tesla-blue-battery-with-snowflake-1.png?fit=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tesla-blue-battery-with-snowflake-1.png?fit=479%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"479\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tesla-blue-battery-with-snowflake-1.png?resize=479%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tesla blue battery with snowflake\" class=\"wp-image-2053\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tesla-blue-battery-with-snowflake-1.png?w=479&amp;ssl=1 479w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tesla-blue-battery-with-snowflake-1.png?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-stay-safe-drive-confidently\"><strong>Stay Safe, Drive Confidently</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla vehicles combine cutting-edge technology with thoughtful design to ensure optimal performance and safety in winter.

Due to its location, a second 8-stall Supercharger should soon follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We first learned a Supercharger might be coming to Severn in October, when <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-posts-first-monthly-supercharger-map-update-adding-and-removing-locations-in-canada/\">Tesla added it as an &#8220;in development&#8221; site</a> to its map of upcoming Supercharger locations. While it still has that status on the map, construction is already well underway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to photos shared on the TMC forum, 8 V4 Supercharger posts have been installed at the Webers Northbound parking lot (8825 ON-11). The reason construction is so far ahead is because the company is using its <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/supercharger/tesla-to-use-prefabricated-installation-method-for-v4-superchargers/\">prefabricated Supercharger installation method</a> at this site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means the Superchargers are pre-assembled at Giga New York and simply placed on the ground and connected to utilities, greatly speeding up the time it takes to install a Supercharger, leaving the bottleneck to how long it takes for the utility company to energize the site, which as we&#8217;ve seen across Canada lately, sometimes takes over a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

This makes sense as the northbound and southbound lanes are separated by a divider, meaning this Supercharger can only cater to those travelling northbound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The southbound parking lot is connected to the other side of the highway by a pedestrian overpass.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"98560\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-begins-construction-of-supercharger-in-severn-with-a-second-station-expected-to-follow-ontario/attachment/webers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webers.jpg?fit=1038%2C671&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1038,671\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"webers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webers.jpg?fit=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webers.jpg?fit=975%2C630&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"975\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webers.jpg?resize=975%2C630&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"webers\" class=\"wp-image-98560\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webers.jpg?resize=1024%2C662&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webers.jpg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webers.jpg?resize=768%2C496&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webers.jpg?w=1038&amp;ssl=1 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, there are a number of Supercharger projects across Canada that have been sitting idle waiting to be turned on. A large number of these projects are in Ontario, where there are currently nine Supercharger stations ready for activation, including the mythical <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-finally-starts-construction-of-brockville-supercharger-ontario/\">Brockville Supercharger</a>, which has been sitting idle for nearly a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check out our Supercharger map below, which we recently updated with user-friendly filters for Open, Under Construction, Proposed, and <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-announces-new-supercharger-voting-winners/\">Supercharger Voting Winners</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/embed?mid=1fFZB69dD_4Y0dOCGycZvXhrte5VSm6Ms&#038;ehbc=2E312F\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-begins-construction-of-supercharger-in-severn-with-a-second-station-expected-to-follow-ontario/\">Tesla begins construction of Supercharger in Severn, with a second station expected to follow [Ontario]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

      "Content": "\n<p>Toyota&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/toyota-and-lexus-join-nacs-coalition/\">Lexus </a>division has pushed back the production timeline of its next-generation electric vehicle (EV), the LF-ZC EV, to mid-2027, a notable delay from the original 2026 schedule. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The LF-ZC EV, intended as a technological leap for Toyota&#8217;s luxury brand, Lexus. Revealed as a concept vehicle last year, it is expected to arrive with a futuristic design and a range of up to 1,000 kilometers (621 miles). Even with such a high range, the automaker is aiming for the LF-ZC EV to be able to be fully charged within 20 minutes. Borrowing a page from Tesla&#8217;s playbook, Toyota will use <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-opts-for-current-casting-method-in-upcoming-affordable-models/\">gigacast manufacturing techniques</a> to build the EV. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Toyota hasn&#8217;t officially confirmed any changes to the production schedule, a report from Japan&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20241127_B01/index.html\">NHK</a> says delaying production to 2027 will give Toyota time to develop these features, ensuring the vehicle can live up to expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, Toyota planned to <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/toyota-plans-to-launch-ten-new-ev-models-by-2026/\">produce 1.5 million EVs by 2026</a>, with a goal of 500,000 sales of advanced next-generation models by 2030. However, Toyota has since adjusted its 2026 EV production target downward to 1 million units. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the first delay for Toyota. As we have previously reported, plans to manufacture EVs at the company&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/toyota-commits-1-3-billion-to-kentucky-plant-for-new-electric-suv/\">$1.3 billion facility</a> in Georgetown, Kentucky, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/toyota-delays-u-s-ev-production-to-2026-citing-slowing-market-demand/\">have been delayed by a year</a>, moving from 2025 to 2026. This adjustment also includes delaying the introduction of an electric three-row SUV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, the company attributed that delay to slowing market demand for EVs.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/toyota-delays-lexus-lf-zc-ev-launch-to-2027/\">Toyota delays Lexus LF-ZC EV launch to 2027</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

Once completed in late 2025, the battery system will store enough electricity to cover 20% of the residential needs in the Marne department, home to approximately 565,000 residents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system is connected to the 225kV national grid managed by R&#xE9;seau de Transport d&#x2019;&#xC9;lectricit&#xE9; (RTE), enabling it to optimize renewable energy distribution and provide critical capacity during peak demand periods. Moreover, the project is poised to capitalize on France&#x2019;s Secondary Reserve (aFRR) market, which creates additional revenue opportunities for flexible energy storage solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla will not only be supplying the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/neoen-powers-up-collie-stage-1-western-australias-largest-battery-powered-by-tesla-megapacks/\">Megapacks </a>to be used in the BESS, but it will also manage the battery&#x2019;s integration into the French electricity market through its advanced <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-autobidder-software-surpasses-330-million-in-profits-for-energy-investors/\">Autobidder platform</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;TagEnergy is proud to announce this flagship project in France, just weeks after connecting the first phase of the Southern Hemisphere&#x2019;s largest wind farm in Australia and the UK&#x2019;s largest transmission-connected battery&#x201D;, said Franck Woitiez, CEO of TagEnergy in a press release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This project aligns with France&#x2019;s Multi-Annual Energy Plan, which calls for a 2.5-fold increase in wind energy capacity and a 4-fold increase in solar capacity by 2035. Alongside this project, TagEnergy has been developing storage and renewable energy solutions worldwide, including the UK&#x2019;s largest transmission-connected battery and Australia&#x2019;s southern hemisphere-leading wind farm.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tagenergy-and-tesla-break-ground-on-frances-largest-battery-energy-storage-project/\">TagEnergy and Tesla Break Ground on France’s Largest Battery Energy Storage Project</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",
