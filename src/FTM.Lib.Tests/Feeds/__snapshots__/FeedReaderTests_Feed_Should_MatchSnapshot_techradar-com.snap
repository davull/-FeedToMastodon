US-based companies attracted the lion’s share, raising $2.9 billion across 127 deals and this does not include OpenAI’s notable $6.6 billion round.</p><p>Some standout funding rounds include Magic, a coding assistant startup that secured $320 million in August, and Glean, an enterprise search company, which raised $260 million in September.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hebbia, a business analytics firm, drew $130 million in July. Furthermore, investments extended beyond the U.S., with China’s Moonshot AI raising $300 million and Japan’s Sakana AI closing a $214 million round focused on scientific discovery.</p><p>Unfortunately, the rapid expansion of generative AI also brings challenges, particularly regarding energy consumption. According to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.bain.com/insights/ai-changes-big-and-small-computing-tech-report-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">Bain & Company</a>, companies deploying AI at scale will require gigawatt-scale data centers, which consume up to 20 times the power of typical data centers today. This demand risks straining global electricity and labour markets.</p><p>The reliance on data centers has already prolonged the use of coal-fired power plants, with <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/ai-boom-to-accelerate-carbon-removal-morgan-stanley-predicts/\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley</a> warning greenhouse gas emissions could triple by 2030 if the trend continues unchecked.</p><p>In response, major data center operators like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/microsoft-embraces-nuclear-power-for-its-energy-hungry-data-centers-as-it-bets-on-infamous-three-mile-island-power-station-for-its-ai-ambitions\">turning to nuclear energy</a> to offset their environmental impact. Microsoft, for instance, announced plans to source power from the controversial Three Mile Island nuclear facility, though such projects could take years to become operational.</p><p>Despite these environmental and technical hurdles, investor interest in generative AI remains high. ElevenLabs, known for its viral voice-cloning tool, is reportedly seeking to raise funds at a $3 billion valuation. Black Forest Labs, the company behind a controversial image generator on the X platform, is also in talks for a $100 million funding round.</p><p>Via <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/20/investments-in-generative-ai-startups-topped-3-9b-in-q3-2024/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>TechCrunch</em></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-you-might-also-like\"><span>You might also like</span></h3>\n<ul><li>These are the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-business-laptops\">best business laptops</a></li><li>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/ai-writer\">best AI writers</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/metas-plan-for-nuclear-datacenter-reportedly-undone-by-bees\">Meta's plan for nuclear datacenter reportedly undone by bees</a></li></ul>\n                                                            </article>\n                            ",

My opening guess was DRAMA, my random word generator continuing to make life difficult for me by giving me a repeated letter in it for the third day in a row. That drew a blank and left 802 possible answers, whereas CRANE (WordleBot's favorite) was down at 81. Advantage: 'bot.</p><p>When I followed with STILE I thought I was certain to uncover at least one letter; after all, these were five of the most common remaining letters. And WordleBot agreed; this was \"exactly what I would've picked in this situation\", it said. But it was also incredibly unlucky. My expected number of answers left after this guess was 19. My <em>actual</em> number of answers left was 62, and I still didn't have a single letter to play with.</p><p>There was almost certainly going to be a vowel included, so I added in O and U for my third guess, together with C, G and H. WordleBot preferred PHONY, and in fairness it would have performed better, leaving only three words whereas COUGH left me with 10. But again, a lot of that was due to (bad) luck on my part; my luck scores at this stage had been 13/99, 4/99 and 9/99. I must have stepped on a black cat while opening an umbrella indoors under a ladder, or something, to deserve that.</p><p>However, it all changed on the fourth guess. I finally had a letter to work with, a yellow U, and worked out that -UN-Y was the likely pattern; it gave me BUNNY, FUNNY, PUNNY, PUNKY and FUNKY, while leaving out the N provided me with PUPPY, FUZZY, PUFFY and BUZZY. WordleBot also had JUNKY.</p><p>Based on those options it made sense to play FUNKY next; it wouldn't guarantee me a solve in five, but at worst it would be a six – and there was always the chance it could be a four. I didn't expect the latter outcome, but after three slices of bad luck finally had some good fortune, as all five letters turned green.</p><p>How did you do today? <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"mailto:marc.mclaren@futurenet.com\" target=\"_blank\">Send me an email </a>and let me know.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-yesterday-s-wordle-hints-game-1274\"><span>Yesterday's Wordle hints (game #1274)</span></h2>\n<p>In a different time zone where it's still Saturday?

Anyway, it rather brings into doubt my assertion that DROOL is an easy Wordle, but I've left it as it was originally written anyway.</em></p><p>Yesterday's Wordle answer (game #1274) was… <strong>DROOL</strong>.</p><p>And <em>relax</em>…</p><p>After two very, very difficult Wordles – the 4.8-average VYING and 5.3-average BOXER, each of which took me five guesses to solve, we have the much simpler DROOL. This has an average of 3.5, according to WordleBot, and is objectively easier. I got it in three, WordleBot got it in three, you probably got it in three or four, and we can all forget about it quickly and move on to Sunday's game.</p><p>Not that DROOL is entirely without complications, given that it contains a repeated letter O. But then again, as my <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/websites-apps/i-analyzed-the-first-1000-wordles-to-look-for-patterns-here-s-what-i-found\">analysis of every Wordle answer</a> shows, O is a likely letter to be repeated, and it's paired here with the very-common R and L. D is more of a middling letter in general – which always surprises me – but DR at the start is very common, ranking 15th in this regard.</p><p>My game was something of a formality, although the curse of the 50/50 hit me again. This could easily have been a 2/6 day for me, because my opening word was DRYLY – which the 'bot said was \"extraordinarily lucky\" and which left me with only two words to choose between.</p><p>These were DRAWL and DROOL, and I went with the one that didn't have the repeated letter. I was wrong. Again.

And even if you've not been playing it, you must surely have heard of it by now, because it's the viral word game phenomenon that took the world by storm last year and is still going strong in 2024.</p><p>We've got a full guide to the game in our <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/wordle\">What is Wordle</a> page, but if you just want a refresher then here are the basics.</p>\n<section class=\"article__schema-question\"><h3>What is Wordle?</h3><article class=\"article__schema-answer\"><p>Wordle challenges you to guess a new five-letter word each day. You get six guesses, with each one revealing a little more information. If one of the letters in your guess is in the answer and in the right place, it turns green. If it's in the answer but in the wrong place, it turns yellow. And if it's not in the answer at all it turns gray. Simple, eh?</p><p>It's played online via the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Wordle website</strong></a> or the New York Times' Crossword app (<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/new-york-times-crossword/id307569751\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">iOS</a> / <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nytimes.crossword\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Android</a>), and is entirely free. </p><p>Crucially, the answer is the same for everyone each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world, rather than just against yourself or the game. The puzzle then resets each day at midnight in your local time, giving you a new challenge, and the chance to extend your streak.</p></article></section>\n<section class=\"article__schema-question\"><h3>What are the Wordle rules?</h3><p>The rules of Wordle are pretty straightforward, but with a couple of curveballs thrown in for good measure.</p><article class=\"article__schema-answer\"><p><strong>1.</strong> Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Letters that are not in the answer turn gray.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Answers are never plural.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Letters can appear more than once. So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Each guess must be a valid word in Wordle's dictionary. You can't guess ABCDE, for instance.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses unless you play on Hard mode.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> You have six guesses to solve the Wordle.</p><p><strong>9.</strong> You must complete the daily Wordle before midnight in your timezone.</p><p><strong>10.</strong> All answers are drawn from Wordle's list of 2,309 solutions. However…</p><p><strong>11.</strong> Wordle will accept a wider pool of words as guesses – some 10,000 of them. For instance, you can guess a plural such as WORDS. It definitely won't be right (see point 4 above), but Wordle will accept it as a guess.</p></article></section>\n                                                            </article>\n                            ",

While the Border Patrol depends on these systems to monitor remote areas, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for maintaining the towers. This division of responsibility creates delays in repairs and maintenance, undermining the network’s effectiveness.</p><p>The Remote Video Surveillance System, where many of these cameras are installed, is only one part of the broader surveillance network. However, the entire system has been hampered by poor coordination, frequent project cancellations, and incompatible technologies developed by different vendors.</p><p>The history of surveillance technology at the border is marked by delays, budget overruns, and cancelled programs. One prominent example is the Secure Border Initiative Network (SBInet), which aimed to deploy towers across the U.S.-Mexico border. By 2010, after spending $1 billion, only 15 towers had been installed along a 53-mile stretch of Arizona’s border, covering just a fraction of the 387-mile expanse. The program was eventually scrapped in 2011 following internal reviews that criticized its performance and high costs.</p><p>There have been attempts to replace SBInet with new initiatives, such as the Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan and the Southwest Border Technology Plan. However, they are also struggling.</p><p>Over the past two decades, the U.S. government has spent nearly $6 billion on surveillance towers and made efforts to consolidate the various systems into the Integrated Surveillance Towers network. However, there are challenges due to incompatible components and outdated technology.</p><p>A recurring issue with the surveillance towers is the absence of meaningful performance metrics to evaluate their effectiveness. In a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-17-331\" target=\"_blank\">2017 report</a>, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticized the Border Patrol for failing to assess whether these technologies were improving security. The GAO urged the agency to develop performance metrics, but recent assessments suggest that little progress has been made.</p><p>In February 2023, the GAO noted that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials expect operational shortfalls of up to 36% by 2025, putting more towers at risk of becoming non-functional. Without clear benchmarks for success, it remains difficult to determine how much these expensive surveillance systems contribute to national security efforts.</p><p>The outages have frustrated Border Patrol agents, who rely on the cameras to monitor vast, remote regions. There are legitimate concerns about officer safety and border security due to non-operational towers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-you-might-also-like\"><span>You might also like</span></h3>\n<ul><li>These are the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-endpoint-security-software\">best endpoint protection</a> solutions</li><li>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn-for-business\">best business VPNs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/one-of-the-nastiest-ransomware-groups-around-may-have-a-whole-new-way-of-doing-things\">One of the nastiest ransomware groups around may have a whole new way of doing things</a></li></ul>\n                                                            </article>\n                            ",

Pick up anything mass-produced these days – be it clothing, toys, or technology products – and there's a good chance you’ll find this phrase emblazoned on a label or plastic underside.</p><p>In the smartphone world, devices made by Chinese brands have long been seen as a curiosity – lesser-known phones with impressive specs that are often unavailable in Western markets.</p><p>However, while it’s still very difficult to get a hold of a Chinese phone in the US, companies like Xiaomi and Oppo have made strides in either entering or returning to local smartphone scenes in the UK, Australia, and mainland Europe.</p><p>Oppo, for instance, recently returned to the UK with the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review\">Oppo Find X8 Pro</a>, a hugely impressive device that rivals the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review\">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-16-pro-review\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> with its dazzling screen and exceptional photography capabilities.</p><p>Xiaomi, too, offers a wide range of high-end devices; our list of the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-xiaomi-phones\">best Xiaomi phones</a> is currently capped by the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/xiaomi-phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review\">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, which lives up to its name with a ludicrous quad-camera system centered on a 1-inch sensor.</p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:5912px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.26%;\"><img id=\"uKJ4AzAEDNB69yjxZb44RA\" name=\"DSC_1165-min.jpg\" alt=\"Xiaomi 14 Ultra\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uKJ4AzAEDNB69yjxZb44RA.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"5912\" height=\"3326\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">The Xiaomi 14 Ultra is among the best phones we've tested this year </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future / Roland Moore-Colyer)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>At the start of the Chinese smartphone boom, the sources of inspiration for these high-spec devices were obvious. Manufacturers including Huawei and OnePlus were once associated with producing – how to put this? – affectionate renditions of more popular flagships.</p><p>For instance, the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/huawei-mate-20-pro-review\">Huawei Mate 20 Pro</a>, released in 2018, took design and software cues from the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-review\">iPhone XS</a>, while 2020’s <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oneplus-8t-review\">OnePlus 8T</a> shared an uncanny resemblance with the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s20-full-review\">Samsung Galaxy S20</a>.</p><p>This proved to be a sustainable and lucrative business practice, as these Chinese brands were generally able to undercut the competition by fairly significant margins, offering consumers iPhone- and Samsung-rivaling products at more accessible prices. For the most part, this sentiment remains true for the mid-range models offered by these companies.</p><p>However, following the smartphone industry’s switch to tiered flagship families, there seems to be a different priority in mind for high-end Chinese mobile makers: overtaking the Western competition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"better-products-bigger-prices-6\">Better products, bigger prices</h2>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3771px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.27%;\"><img id=\"UGdDEBwiXs73SDQQnoT9kV\" name=\"image00021 (1).jpg\" alt=\"Honor Magic 6 Pro\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGdDEBwiXs73SDQQnoT9kV.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3771\" height=\"2122\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">The Honor Magic 6 Pro costs £1,099 in the UK </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future / Axel Metz)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra, for example, retails for £1,299 (around $1,650) – that's even more than the most expensive globally available slab phone, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, which starts at $1,299 / £1,249 / AU$2,199.</p><p>And while other brands aren’t pushing the envelope quite as much as Xiaomi, phones like the Oppo Find X8 Pro (£1,050 / AU$1,799) and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review\">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a> (£1,099) still approach or exceed the price of premium flagships from Apple, Google, and Samsung.</p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>The modus operandi for Chinese flagship challengers has changed: where previously these companies sought to offer comparable performance at cheaper prices, now they're focused on delivering better performance at bigger prices.</p></blockquote></figure>\n<p>Keep in mind, too, that we’ve yet to see the rumored Oppo Find X8 Ultra surface, which will no doubt carry an even heavier price tag than its Pro counterpart.</p><p>Similarly, while the globally available <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/android/oneplus-12-review\">OnePlus 12</a> does surpass the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-16-review\">iPhone 16</a>, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-review\">Samsung Galaxy S24</a>, and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-9-review\">Google Pixel 9</a> on many spec fronts, it also matches them all on price at $799 / £849 – meanwhile, last year’s <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oneplus-11\">OnePlus 11</a> was notably cheaper, at $699 / £729 / AU$1,199.</p><p>This is to say that the modus operandi for Chinese flagship challengers has changed: where previously these companies sought to offer comparable performance at cheaper prices, now they're focused on delivering better performance at bigger prices.</p><p>Of course, the likes of Xiaomi, OnePlus, and Honor are well within their rights to shift their strategies in such a way; after all, they're producing high-quality devices. But the fact remains that from a consumer perspective, the days of nabbing a flagship-level phone for a mid-range price could be coming to an end.</p><p>So, if you’re looking for a powerful phone, don’t mind using Android, and aren’t particularly loyal to a major brand, it might be wise to pick up a high-powered Chinese phone before the de facto discounts disappear completely.</p><p>For more on the latest smartphones from all over the world – including the tri-folding <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/huawei-phones/huaweis-tri-fold-phone-is-so-expensive-you-could-buy-four-ps5-pros-for-the-same-price\">Huawei Mate XT</a> – be sure to check out our <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones\">phones</a> coverage.

In October 2022, the US implemented export controls to block China's access to advanced semiconductor technologies, especially those essential for AI development. These export controls came alongside earlier tariff hikes on Chinese imports.</p><p>The U.S. government has been widening its efforts to curb the transfer of U.S. capital and expertise into China, addressing concerns over national security and military competition.</p><p>In 2018, the Trump administration initiated tariffs on Chinese goods and began restricting Chinese investments in US technology sectors, citing concerns over \"forced technology transfer\" and the potential military applications of advanced technologies.</p><p>Under the Biden administration, this did not change as the U.S. seeks to prevent technology and investments from supporting China’s military modernization, which officials worry could undermine America’s strategic interests.</p><p>The Treasury has been working on these restrictions since mid-2023, when it released initial proposals to potentially ban certain investments in China. The initial proposals drew public feedback from citizens and businesses, helping the department refine the scope of the rules.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/11/15/2024-25422/provisions-pertaining-to-us-investments-in-certain-national-security-technologies-and-products-in\" target=\"_blank\">finalized regulations</a>, outlined by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Investment Security are expected to strike a balance between protecting U.S. security interests and avoiding unnecessary disruption to commercial relations.</p><p>“The potential military, intelligence, surveillance, and cyber-enabled applications of these technologies and products pose risks to U.S. national security particularly when developed by a country of concern such as the PRC,” the Treasury Department notification said.</p>\n<h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-you-might-also-like\"><span>You might also like</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-endpoint-security-software\">best endpoint protection</a></li><li>These are the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-patch-management-tools\">best patch management software</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention-huawei-is-pairing-its-supercharged-ssd-with-a-60-year-old-piece-of-technology-seemingly-because-of-us-export-restrictions\">Huawei pairs a supercharged SSD with tape storage in response to US export restrictions</a></li></ul>\n                                                            </article>\n                            ",

      "Content": "\n                            <article>\n                                <p>Another year, another Game Awards trailer drop that gets people’s hackles up on Reddit. This time it’s <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/borderlands-4-has-been-revealed-and-yeah-it-looks-very-borderlands-to-us\"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>, a game that has the unenviable task of outdoing both the series’ phenomenal second installment and the highly mixed response to <em>Borderlands 3</em>. No, I’m not going to discuss the movie here, I wiped my memories of it with a Neuralyzer I borrowed from Will Smith.</p><p>We already knew a fourth <em>Borderlands </em>title was on the way thanks to a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/borderlands-4-has-officially-been-announced\">CGI reveal trailer back in August</a>, but this new trailer gave us both some actual in-engine gameplay footage (which, unsurprisingly, looks much like the third game) and our first look at the new title’s four playable Vault Hunters. And boy, some Redditors sure aren’t happy about them.</p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2560px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"P5aCtz9NWvMSx7WxkzaovN\" name=\"borderlands4screenshot2\" alt=\"Two of the Borderlands 4 protagonists, one of whom is a Siren with pink tattoos.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P5aCtz9NWvMSx7WxkzaovN.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">I actually think this might be one of the better Siren designs.

Another user, u/k_afka_, says: “Those vaulthunters look kinda bland to me, but hopefully they're more interesting than they appear”.</p><p>I get it, I do. These four new heroes don’t fill me with excitement purely based on their looks. Here’s the thing, though: <em>Borderlands </em>has basically never been good at making truly iconic player character designs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-new-vault-hunters-are-cut-from-the-same-cloth-as-the-old-6\">The new Vault Hunters are cut from the same cloth as the old</h2>\n<p>I’m being serious here: the <em>Borderlands</em> games might feature some visually striking characters here and there, but what makes most of the larger-than-life figures you meet on Pandora and beyond interesting are their stellar voice performances and unusual abilities.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the earlier Vault Hunters, for example. Look at these four right here:</p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"5xsmGrhHikFf3sLBRTCg53\" name=\"1734099035.jpg\" alt=\"The protagonists of the first Borderlands game in front of a vehicle in-game.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5xsmGrhHikFf3sLBRTCg53.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">Come on, you can't tell me these four are the pinnacle of visually striking character designs. </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Gearbox)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Mordecai from the original game is basically just a skinny dude with a goatee, a sword, and a tight-fitting outfit. What made him interesting and likable was his extremely angry pet bird, low-key offbeat humor, and the extra characterization he got in the sequel as a friendly NPC. The same goes for Roland, who was essentially just ‘ex-soldier guy’ in the first game before getting a starring role in the narrative of <em>Borderlands 2</em>. Hell, Brick - who I love - is at first glance literally just a big muscly man in a tank top. Not exactly world-shattering character design there, Gearbox.</p><p>Sure, we’ve got some fun ones: the playable Sirens Lilith, Maya, and Amara all look fairly interesting, though again, it’s their magical abilities that make them pop from an aesthetic standpoint. And I can’t ignore Zer0 and his funky holographic faceplate, though what really makes him stick in my memory is his deadpan, exclusively-in-haiku dialogue.</p><p>The thing is, the world of <em>Borderlands </em>is full of characters who, in a less violent and unhinged universe, could’ve probably been pretty ordinary people. That’s part of the appeal: you’re not playing as the Chosen One, you’re just some random treasure-seeker who gets wrapped up in a world-saving adventure wearing whatever ragged-ass clothes you happened to put on that morning.</p><p>So I’m asking you, unhappy Redditors: give these newbies a chance. Sure, we’re getting those same old tropes - cool guy, beefy guy, techy girl, magic girl - but let’s at least see what cool ways they have to murder people before we pass judgment on them, yeah?</p>\n<h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-you-might-also-like\"><span>You might also like...</span></h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/the-witcher-4-officially-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024-with-brutal-trailer-and-confirms-that-ciri-will-star-as-the-titular-witcher\">The Witcher 4 officially revealed at The Game Awards 2024 with brutal trailer and confirms that Ciri will star as the titular Witcher</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/gaming/amazon-prime-subscribers-can-claim-a-frankly-absurd-number-of-free-games-like-the-outer-worlds-and-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-with-prime-gaming-right-now-these-are-my-top-picks\">Amazon Prime subscribers can claim a frankly absurd number of free games like with Prime Gaming right now - these are my top picks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/gaming/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-a-new-franchise-from-naughty-dog-has-been-revealed\">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a new franchise from Naughty Dog, has been revealed</a></li></ul>\n                                                            </article>\n                            ",

Companies will also be required to enforce multi-factor <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-authenticator-apps\">authentication</a> (MFA) on all critical systems and require passwords that are at least 16 characters long to prevent unauthorized access.</p><p>Vulnerability management is another key focus, and organizations must remediate and address any known exploited vulnerabilities or critical flaws within 14 days, even if exploitation has not been confirmed. High-severity vulnerabilities must be fixed within 30 days.</p><p>The new proposal also emphasizes network transparency, and companies are required to maintain accurate network topologies to enhance their ability to identify and respond to security incidents.</p><p>Immediate revocation of access for employees following termination or changes in role is mandated to prevent insider threats. Additionally, unauthorized hardware, such as USB devices, will be prohibited from connecting to systems that handle sensitive data, further reducing the risk of data leakage.</p><p>In addition to system-level protections, CISA’s proposal introduces robust data-level measures aimed at minimizing the exposure of personal and government information. Organizations will be encouraged to collect only the data that is essential for their operations and, where possible, mask or de-identify it to prevent unauthorized access. Encryption will play a vital role in securing data during any transaction that involves a “restricted entity,” ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be easily deciphered.</p><p>A critical requirement is that <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-encryption-software\">encryption</a> keys must not be stored alongside the data they protect, particularly in regions identified as countries of concern. Furthermore, organizations will also be encouraged to adopt advanced privacy-preserving techniques, such as homomorphic encryption or differential privacy, which allow data to be processed without exposing the underlying information.</p><p>CISA is seeking public feedback on the proposed requirements to refine the framework before it is finalized. Interested stakeholders, including industry leaders and cybersecurity experts, are invited to submit their comments via regulations.gov by entering CISA-2024-0029 in the search field and following the instructions to provide input.</p><p>Via <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-proposes-new-security-requirements-to-protect-govt-personal-data/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>BleepingComputer</em></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-you-might-also-like\"><span>You might also like</span></h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/google-has-blocked-a-huge-network-of-pro-china-propaganda-news-websites\">Google has blocked a huge network of pro-China propaganda news websites</a></li><li>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-antivirus\">best antivirus</a></li><li>These are the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager\">best password managers</a></li></ul>\n                                                            </article>\n                            ",

Given Europe’s stringent data privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the fear of authorities or AI misusing data is far lower than it would be in the US.

class=\"article__schema-question\"><h3>On which days have there been two Wordle answers?</h3><article class=\"article__schema-answer\"><p>One of the key things about Wordle is that everyone gets the same answer each day. Or is it? There have been four occasions when the game has served up two different solutions, causing no end of consternation among players.</p><p>The first two were victims of the New York Times' purchase of the game in February 2022. The NYT removed around a dozen words that it decided were too difficult for players, or that were in some way controversial.</p><p>However, at that time people could play either via the NYT's games site, or via the original Wordle website created by Josh Wardle. And unfortunately, the changes made by the NYT didn't always filter through correctly to the original version.</p><p>The result was that on February 15, 2022 some people got AROMA and some the much harder AGORA for puzzle #241. Then on March 30, the same thing happened with STOVE and HARRY for game #284; the NYT thought people would only consider HARRY to be a name, and not a verb (as in to harrass), so it removed it.</p><p>The problem reoccurred in May 2022. On May 10 (game #324), the NYT <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/wordle-disaster-as-two-different-answers-appear-on-the-same-day\">removed the word FETUS</a> in the wake of the US Supreme Court's decision to repeal Roe vs Wade, deeming it too controversial. Instead, most players got SHINE. The next day, some players got GECKO while others received BUTCH, due to the NYT's servers not yet having reset for everyone from the previous day's change.</p></article></section>\n                                                            </article>\n                            ",

One of the primary challenges when deploying large language models (LLMs) is optimizing them for specific hardware environments. Each accelerator, whether it is an NVIDIA<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458\"> GPU </a>or an AMD GPU, requires fine-tuning to extract maximum performance.</p><p>With HUGS, these optimizations are managed automatically, delivering high throughput out of the box. In addition to NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, the company promises that its support will soon extend to AWS Inferentia and Google TPUs.</p><p>Hugging Face aims to ease the transition from black-box APIs to open, self-hosted solutions with support for a wide array of models, including well-known<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/best-llms\"> LLMs </a>like Llama and Gemma, with plans to introduce multimodal models such as Idefics and Llava soon. In the future, the company says it will include embedding models like BGE and Jina<em>, </em>giving developers even more options to customize their AI applications.</p><p>This service uses standardized APIs compatible with OpenAI’s model interfaces, therefore, developers can migrate their own code.</p><p>For startups in particular, HUGS provides an opportunity to build AI applications without incurring the high costs associated with proprietary platforms. The availability of one-click deployments on DigitalOcean makes it even easier for small teams to experiment with generative AI technologies.</p><p>Meanwhile, larger enterprises can leverage HUGS to scale their applications without being locked into a single cloud provider or proprietary API. On DigitalOcean, HUGS is included at no extra charge beyond the standard cost of GPU Droplets. Hugging Face also offers custom deployment solutions for enterprises through its Enterprise Hub.</p>\n<h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-you-might-also-like\"><span>You might also like</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Take a look at the<a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-small-business-software\"> best small business software</a></li><li>These are the<a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-online-collaboration-tools\"> best online collaboration tools</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/using-an-ai-pc-may-actually-make-users-less-productive-for-now\">Using an AI PC may actually make users less productive — for now</a></li></ul>\n                                                            </article>\n                            ",

href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s24\">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> series – so in other words the main things that might make you consider buying a Samsung Galaxy S25 over a Galaxy S24.</p><p>You’ll find all of these claimed features and upgrades below, and note that we’re looking at the whole Samsung Galaxy S25 line here – so the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus and <a

of a MagSafe-like system on the Samsung Galaxy S25 line, though exactly how it will work is uncertain.</p><p>One rumor suggested <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/the-latest-samsung-galaxy-s25-pricing-and-storage-leaks-have-me-worried\">the Samsung Galaxy S25 series would all support Qi2 wireless charging</a>, which is a very similar tech to MagSafe, with magnets in the phone that let you magnetically attach wireless chargers and accessories, such as battery packs and tripods.</p><p>However, another suggested that instead <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-could-sell-magsafe-like-magnetic-accessories-for-the-samsung-galaxy-s25\">Samsung might simply sell some magnetic cases</a>, which you could then attach magnetic accessories to.</p><p>We’re inclined to say that both of these rumors are probably true – that the phones will support <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/qi2-has-finally-landed-and-its-about-to-make-wireless-chargers-a-lot-better\">Qi2 charging</a>, but also that Samsung might release a range of magnetic cases, perhaps so that you can still firmly attach magnetic accessories when there’s a case on the phone.</p>\n<h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-a-new-ultra-wide-camera\"><span>A new

modest 12MP ultra-wide being replaced with a more pixel-packed 50MP sensor.</p><p>This should allow for more detailed photos, and will hopefully lead to an overall quality increase, bringing ultra-wide shots more in line with photos taken with the main camera.</p><p>However, this upgrade is reportedly just for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, with the other models likely sticking with the

Paramount Plus Essential also works out cheaper than <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/streaming/amazon-prime-video\">Prime Video</a>'s video-only option.</p><p>Does that make Paramount Plus worthwhile? As with all streamers, that depends on whether its content library suits your needs. There are undoubtedly platforms offering bigger selections of movies and TV shows, while Max (with <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-watch-the-dceu-movies-in-order\">DC</a>, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/tag/the-lord-of-the-rings\"><em>The Lord of the Rings</em></a> and the HBO back catalogue) and Disney Plus (with Star Wars, Marvel, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/features/pixar-movies-ranked-our-verdict-on-all-25-films-from-toy-story-to-turning-red\">Pixar</a>, and more) are home to higher profile franchises.</p><p>For Trekkies, however, more than 800 episodes of voyages on the final frontier make Paramount Plus a no-brainer, while the UEFA Champions League and NFL matches make it appealing to sports fans – especially on the $7.99 a month 'Essential' tier. There are also plenty of bona fide movie and TV classics to enjoy. In other words, there's plenty to like about Paramount Plus but several other services arguably have broader appeal.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For more Paramount Plus coverage, read our guides on the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-paramount-plus-shows\">best Paramount Plus shows</a> and the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-paramount-plus-movies-the-top-movies-to-stream-on-paramount-plus-right-now/\">best Paramount Plus movies</a>.</p>\n                                                            </article>\n                            ",
