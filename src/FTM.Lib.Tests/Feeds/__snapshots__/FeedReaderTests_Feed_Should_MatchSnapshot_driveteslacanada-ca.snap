According to a new message on the Design Studio in the United States, customers who purchase or lease a new Model S will enjoy free Supercharging for the duration of their ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new free Supercharging offer applies only to new Model S vehicles purchased or leased on or after December 13, 2024. The benefit is tied to the owner&#8217;s Tesla account, meaning it cannot be transferred to another vehicle, person, or order, even if the vehicle is sold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla does say however that they can removed your lifetime free Supercharging if &#8220;in the event of excessive charging or unpaid fees related to Supercharging.&#8221; Tesla did not elaborate on what the threshold for &#8220;excessive charging&#8221; is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This incentive can be staked with other current promotions. The same incentive is not available on the Model X, it has 3 months of free Supercharging on new orders.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-attachment-id=\"98885\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-brings-back-free-lifetime-supercharging-on-model-s-in-the-us/attachment/free-supercharging-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/free-supercharging.jpg?fit=941%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"941,488\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"free-supercharging\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/free-supercharging.jpg?fit=300%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/free-supercharging.jpg?fit=941%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"941\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/free-supercharging.jpg?resize=941%2C488&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98885\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/free-supercharging.jpg?w=941&amp;ssl=1 941w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/free-supercharging.jpg?resize=300%2C156&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/free-supercharging.jpg?resize=768%2C398&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Tesla</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla’s free lifetime Supercharging dates back to the early days of the Model S. When the company launched the Model S in 2012, free unlimited Supercharging was included as a standard feature, a move that helped establish Tesla in the automotive industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The offer was phased out in early 2017 as Tesla sought to improve the financial sustainability of its rapidly expanding Supercharger network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, Tesla has occasionally revived free Supercharging as a limited-time incentive to drive sales during key periods. The company has also sometimes allowed owners with <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-offering-free-lifetime-supercharging-transfer-on-new-model-s-x-y-orders/\">lifetime free Supercharging to transfer it</a> to a new vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the return of free lifetime Supercharging is a nice perk, it has come with a cost. Also on Friday <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-increases-model-s-prices-by-5000-in-the-us/\">Tesla increased prices on both the Model S All-Wheel Drive (AWD) and Plaid by $5,000 in the US</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-brings-back-free-lifetime-supercharging-on-model-s-in-the-us/\">Tesla brings back free lifetime Supercharging on Model S in the US</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

According to an update to the Design Studio on Friday, the price of both trims of the Model S has increased by $5,000 in the United States. The base Model S All-Wheel Drive (AWD) now starts at $79,990, up from $74,990, while the Model S Plaid carries a new price tag of $94,990, up from $89,990.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been no changes to pricing for any of the other models, and there have been no similar price changes in Canada.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img data-attachment-id=\"98878\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-increases-model-s-prices-by-5000-in-the-us/attachment/price-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/price.jpg?fit=374%2C325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"374,325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"price\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/price.jpg?fit=300%2C261&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/price.jpg?fit=374%2C325&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"374\" height=\"325\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/price.jpg?resize=374%2C325&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98878\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/price.jpg?w=374&amp;ssl=1 374w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/price.jpg?resize=300%2C261&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Tesla</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This price adjustment is Tesla&#8217;s first major change to the Model S lineup in several months. The last time Tesla <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-raises-model-s-x-prices-in-canada-and-the-us/\">adjusted prices on its flagship sedan was back in July</a>, when the company raised prices on both the Model S and Model X in Canada by as much as $6,000, and in the United States by $2,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla’s decision to raise prices comes at an interesting time, and while Tesla has been known to adjust pricing frequently, the $5,000 increase stands out for two reasons. The first is that it is a significant jump, especially when combined with the earlier price increase in July, making the Model S $7,000 more expensive than it was five months ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-brings-back-free-lifetime-supercharging-on-model-s-in-the-us/\">Tesla brings back free lifetime Supercharging on Model S in the US</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second is the lackluster sales seen by the Model S recently. The company now lumps together sales of the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck into the &#8220;other&#8221; category. Based on <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/cybertruck/tesla-cybertruck-hits-new-us-milestone-becoming-best-selling-vehicle-over-100k-in-june/\">sales of the Cybertruck</a>, which we&#8217;ve been able to get a pretty <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-cybertruck-gets-recalls-over-wiper-and-trim-issues/\">accurate figure of from recalls</a>, indicate Model S/X sales were as low as 10,000-12,000 in the third quarter, compared to nearly 20,000 reported in the same quarter in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add in the fact that Tesla is <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-projects-record-breaking-q4-and-2024-deliveries/\">aiming for a record quarter of deliveries</a>, pushing for more than 515,000 units in the final three months of the year, and the timing of a $5,000 price increase is a little surprising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why do you think Tesla raised the price of the Model S in the US?

The service was expanded to <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-adds-six-new-cybertruck-wrap-colours/\">include the Cybertruck</a> following its launch a few months later, offering customers a choice between two colours &#8211; Matte Black and Satin White.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-adds-six-new-cybertruck-wrap-colours/\">colour choices expanded to as many as 11</a>, but they were pricey &#8211; as much as US$8,000 for the Cybertruck and US$6,500 for the Model 3/Y. The service was also only available at three Service Centers in California, and briefly available at one location in Texas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month Tesla removed the Cybertruck wrap option from its online shop, but kept the service for the Model 3 and Model Y. Now the service has returned for the Cybertruck, at a lower price, with the discounts extending to the Model 3 and Model Y.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the updated Tesla Shop <a href=\"https://shop.tesla.com/product/cybertruck-_-model-3_y-vinyl-wrap\">listing</a>, Cybertruck wraps now cost US$4,500, and Model 3/Y wraps cost US$4,000. The listing no longer shows what colours are available, but based on the images, it looks like some new colours have been introduced, with up to 8 colours available for each vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"98869\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-lowers-price-wraps-brings-back-cybertruck-wraps-expands-availability/attachment/all-wraps/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/all-wraps-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1712&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1712\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"all wraps\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/all-wraps-scaled.jpg?fit=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/all-wraps-scaled.jpg?fit=975%2C652&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"975\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/all-wraps.jpg?resize=975%2C652&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98869\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/all-wraps-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C685&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/all-wraps-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/all-wraps-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C514&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/all-wraps-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1027&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/all-wraps-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1370&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/all-wraps-scaled.jpg?resize=272%2C182&amp;ssl=1 272w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/all-wraps-scaled.jpg?w=1950&amp;ssl=1 1950w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the lower prices, Tesla is now also offering their wraps out of their Service Center in Seattle, Washington.

As the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/qatar-airways-debuts-worlds-first-boeing-777-with-starlink-internet/\">first airline to equip Boeing 777s with this technology</a>, Qatar Airways provided Toronto-bound passengers with seamless connectivity, allowing for activities such as streaming, gaming, and working during their entire flight, from the moment they board until the plane arrives at the gate at its destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Qatar Airways has exceeded its own expectations. Initially targeting 12 aircraft for this upgrade by the end of 2024, the airline is ahead of schedule, fitting 15 777s with Starlink in just 55 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Toronto-Doha route operates three times weekly, every Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. Each flight departs Doha at 8:10 a.m. and arriving in Toronto at 2:15 p.m. The return journey departs Toronto at 8:00 p.m., arriving in Doha the following afternoon.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">We are pleased to announce our first flight to Toronto! <br /><br />Now flying three times weekly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/QatarAirways?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#QatarAirways</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoingPlacesTogether?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoingPlacesTogether</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FWp4qcvynG\">pic.twitter.com/FWp4qcvynG</a></p>\n— Qatar Airways (@qatarairways) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/qatarairways/status/1867159558751395881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 12, 2024</a></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/qatar-airways-launches-toronto-route-with-starlink-equipped-boeing-777s/\">Qatar Airways Launches Toronto Route with Starlink-Equipped Boeing 777s</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

      "Content": "\n<p><a href=\"http://driveteslacanada.ca/space-x\">SpaceX </a>is petitioning to turn its Starbase facility in South Texas into an officially incorporated city. Located near Boca Chica Beach on the southern tip of Texas near the US/Mexico border, the Starbase site has already hosts the production and testing of SpaceX’s massive Starship rockets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, CEO Elon Musk wants to transform the area into a community that supports their mission to make humanity a multiplanetary species.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 12, SpaceX submitted a formal request to Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño Jr., asking for a local election to decide whether the site should be incorporated. Kathryn Lueders, the general manager of Starbase, detailed the rationale in the letter, emphasizing the need for infrastructure and amenities to attract and retain top talent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To continue growing the workforce necessary to rapidly develop and manufacture Starship, we need the ability to grow Starbase as a community,” the letter stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed incorporation would streamline the development of housing, schools, medical facilities, and other essential services for the 3,400 full-time employees and contractors currently working at Starbase. Lueders also noted that SpaceX already manages several public functions in the area, such as utilities, roads, and even education. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By establishing Starbase as an official city, these responsibilities could transition to public governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk has been vocal about his vision for Starbase for years, first hinting at the idea in a 2021 social media post. While discussions about incorporation have been ongoing, this marks the first time SpaceX has officially filed a petition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk commented on the petition on X, saying, &#8220;SpaceX HQ will now officially be in the city of Starbase, Texas!&#8221; However, Musk was getting a little ahead of himself, as the county’s legal and election teams will review the request to ensure compliance with statutory requirements before proceeding and approving the petition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move to turn Starbase into its own city comes amid Musk’s broader shift of operations to Texas, a state he has praised for its business-friendly environment. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/spacex-and-x-will-relocate-headquarters-from-california-to-texas-elon-musk/\">SpaceX headquarters moved</a> from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, and Musk announced plans to relocate the headquarters of his social media platform X to Austin. These decisions followed Musk’s dissatisfaction with California’s regulatory landscape, which he criticized as stifling innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SpaceX HQ will now officially be in the city of Starbase, Texas! <a href=\"https://t.co/zpN4t3mJQT\">https://t.co/zpN4t3mJQT</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1867382483714502670?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/spacex-proposes-turning-starbase-into-an-official-texas-city/\">SpaceX Proposes Turning Starbase Into an Official Texas City</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

Announced via Tesla’s official Weibo account, the feature enables Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) or Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) software to autonomously navigate from parking spaces to a designated location near the driver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In China, one of the world’s most competitive electric vehicle (EV) markets, the Actually Smart Summon feature will be delivered through over-the-air (OTA) software update. However, just like in North America, the feature is limited to owners with EAP or FSD, which cost ¥32,000 (C$6,250/US$4,390) and ¥64,000 (C$12,500/US$8,780) respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To further entice buyers, Tesla has introduced a promotion offering 90 days of free Enhanced Autopilot access for customers who purchase a Tesla vehicle through a trade-in. This follows an earlier incentive program in which trade-in customers were <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-introduces-giga-shanghai-tour-and-test-drive-incentives-to-boost-sales-in-china/\">entered into a lottery for a chance to tour Giga Shanghai</a>.</p>\n<p>While Tesla has announced the availability of ASS in China, it actually hasn&#8217;t arrived on any vehicles yet, as the software update that enables the feature will likely be released around the Spring Festival in late January.

The vehicle boasts a range of 618km (384 miles). Perhaps most importantly, the Cybertruck is classified as an M1 passenger vehicle rather than a traditional truck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This classification could get Tesla around restrictive regulations that typically apply to light trucks in China, such as being subject to annual inspections, mandatory scrapping after 15 years, and having restricted access to many urban areas, all of which limit their broader appeal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the approval, launching the Cybertruck in China is far from straightforward. The vehicle must still meet stringent requirements for pedestrian safety and other local standards. Furthermore, Tesla might consider developing a modified version of the Cybertruck tailored to international markets, though there has obviously been no official confirmation on that front.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-cybertruck-gets-a-step-closer-to-launch-in-china/\">Tesla Cybertruck gets a step closer to launch in China</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",
