We also won the Wonderfully Welcoming award for being the 2nd most active project for <em>new</em> contributors. This is really just scratching the surface of the week we spent together in San Francisco, and I (<a href=\"https://github.com/missyquarry\">Missy Quarry</a>, your Community &amp; Social Media Manager) would like to share the highlights with everyone who couldn’t make it this year.</p>\n<h3>Table of contents</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#community-comes-together\">Community comes together</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#we-are-number-1\">We are number 1!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#open-source---%EF%B8%8F-of-the-show\">Open Source - ⭐️ of the show</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#connecting-with-the-community\">Connecting with the community</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Community comes together</h2>\n<p>What started as a simple request to attend the event tumbled into not only being a part of the Day 2 Keynote of GitHub Universe ❗❗ but being offered a venue at GitHub HQ for a community meetup. It picked up from there - interviews, speaking on panels, and after-parties - this 2-day event spun into a 7-day trip to San Francisco. Not only was this my first event as a part of an open source project, but it was also my first time meeting <a href=\"https://github.com/balloob\">Paulus</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/frenck\">Frenck</a> in person. Paulus is taller than I expected 😅 and Frenck has legs! 😱</p>\n<p>While there is a lot of good news for us that came out of GitHub Universe (and I <em>will</em> get to that), I would be a poor community manager if I didn’t start this out with the first in-person meetup I coordinated for Home Assistant. 😌</p>\n<p>I knew immediately that I needed custom swag for the event, and got to work with our Graphic Artist, Clelia. We wanted to make sure it was connected to where we were holding the meetup and that it was collectible - we landed on postcards and pins in the shape of stamps.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/postcard-badge.png' alt=\"postcard and badge\">Limited edition San Fran postcard and badge</p>\n<p>And, of course, you can’t go to an event without stickers, so we took our Home Assistant and ESPHome logos with an Open Home Foundation badge and made holographic stickers. ✨</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/shiny.png' alt=\"our shiny stickers\" style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'>\n<p>The event itself ended up being a small gathering, but it was filled with amazing connections and conversations. Paulus and Frenck talked for over an hour about the status of Home Assistant and what we’re working on right now, then took questions from the community members. It was great talking to everyone who attended - being able to bring people from different aspects of life together energizes me, and I am excited to plan whatever the next meetup will be. 👀</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/meetup-audience.jpg' alt=\"Universe meetup ahead of the event at GitHub HQ\"></p>\n<h2>We are number 1!</h2>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/number-1.png' alt=\"We are number one\"></p>\n<p>It was an honor just for Home Assistant to be asked to speak at the Day 2 Keynote; what we <em>didn’t</em> know when we started this ride was that the keynote would announce something new: <strong>we are the #1 open source project on GitHub</strong> by active contributors!! 🎉 Not only that, on the rankings for first-time contributors, we moved up to 2nd place, and an Open Home Foundation collaboration partner, <a href=\"https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/\">Zigbee2MQTT</a>, is also now in the top 10! 🥳 This is all featured in the <a href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/\">GitHub Octoverse 2024 report</a>, which is a really interesting read.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/octoverse-contributors.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"top five projects by contributors - source GitHub Octoverse 2024 report\">\n<p>Our friends at GitHub did a great job of making sure we were surprised by this news—and believe me when I say we lost our collective minds when they revealed it to us. 😎 We also found out that we’ve won GitHub’s <a href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/celebrating-the-github-awards-2024-recipients/#wonderfully-welcoming-award\">Wonderfully Welcoming Award</a>, which recognizes how we attract and support new contributors to our project.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/wonderfully-welcoming.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Wonderfully welcoming award\">\n<h2>Open Source - ⭐️ of the show</h2>\n<p>Paulus and Frenck were at keynote rehearsals Friday, Sunday, and Monday to be prepared for Wednesday. So I picked up my badge Monday morning, which was a hackable board with an e-ink display programmed to show our names - the little details they put into this event were quite pleasing. 🤩</p>\n<p>There was a community session where GitHub showed off a little of what they would reveal on Day 2. At the breakout session, I was able to share our pain points about moderating a community directly on GitHub, and it was good to hear how other projects do this on the platform.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/day-1-keynote.jpg' alt=\"Paulus, Frenck and myself at the Day 1 keynote\">Paulus, Frenck and myself at the Day 1 keynote</p>\n<p>Day 1 is when we had our booth in the <a href=\"https://github.blog/open-source/10-projects-in-the-open-source-zone-at-github-universe-2024/\">Open Source Zone</a>, but I was also set to represent Home Assistant at a panel. The session was called <a href=\"https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe24/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog/session/1715376172449001OEqW\">Cha-ching! How to attract funding for your open source projects</a>; I was very excited to tell our story since Home Assistant is funded by y’all - the community - through our <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud subscription</a>, and not investors. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that others on the panel shared our approach to building a sustainable project through community support! I had great conversations with several people working on other open source projects like Homebrew and Ladybird.</p>\n<p>Our booth was a great success, and we had so many members of the community come up to us to let us know how much they love Home Assistant, along with some people who had never heard of us curious to learn more. We were surprised to hear that some people had not yet tried the <a href=\"/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#sections-dashboard-no-longer-experimental\">new Sections dashboard</a>, which we were demoing at the booth. It was really useful to get this feedback in person. All of them took stickers. 😆</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/booth.jpg' alt=\"Our booth in the Open Source Zone\">Our booth in the <a href=\"https://github.blog/open-source/10-projects-in-the-open-source-zone-at-github-universe-2024/\">Open Source Zone</a></p>\n<p>Day 2 was when Paulus and Frenck took the stage, and I got there early to ensure I got a good seat up front. We had not only a good crowd in person, but <a href=\"https://github.com/joostlek\">Joost</a> hosted a watch party on the Community Stage in <a href=\"/join-chat\">our Discord server</a>!</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/ha-keynote.jpg' alt=\"Frenck and Paulus on the keynote stage representing Home Assistant\">Their final message to the crowd - <i>what are you going to build?</i></p>\n<p>The guys did amazing up on stage! 🤩 It was wonderful to see Paulus explain why Home Assistant was built and how it connects to GitHub’s ambitious goal of 1 billion developers. Frenck shared not only what we’ve done to grow the largest open community on GitHub, but also how the community collectively shapes the project’s direction. <a href=\"https://github.com/kdaigle\">Kyle Daigle</a>, a fellow Home Assistant user and GitHub COO, joined Frenck and Paulus on stage and did a really fun Home Assistant live demo. Paulus also shared how he secured the future of the project by giving it to the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, and its mission to bring privacy, choice, and sustainability to the smart home. Catch their segment <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh9A4LvuGHM&amp;t=679s\">here</a>, but I would recommend watching the entire keynote - GitHub is doing good stuff for new developers. 😌</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"uh9A4LvuGHM\" videoStartAt=\"679\" videotitle=\"GitHub Universe Day 2 Keynote - featuring Home Assistant\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<p>After the keynote, Paulus and Frenck both did interviews, and even gave away an extra Home Assistant Green we brought to the guest speaker representing <a href=\"https://github.com/hackclub\">Hack Club</a>. We spent the rest of the day on the show floor, meeting more of the community and enjoying all the fun.</p>\n<h2>Connecting with the community</h2>\n<p>It was an amazing event, and so nice to meet my colleagues Paulus and Frenck after months of working with them remotely. Most of all, it was great to meet the community, get feedback and hear how Home Assistant improves their lives. Thanks to everyone who took the time to talk to us! 🥰</p>\n<p>GitHub was an incredible host, and it was nice to give something back to them after so many years of support they have given this project. At Universe, they gave us a platform to explain how important our community is and how your support has kept Home Assistant thriving and continuously growing - becoming the top open source project on the platform. The next time you see a blog from me should be when I announce Home Assistant Community Day. 😌</p>\n",

Our plan is categorized into the following product areas:</p>\n<h3>Automations</h3>\n<h4>In good shape: Make automations easier to organize</h4>\n<p>For a long time, the ability to organize automation was at the top of our feature requests. Therefore, organizing automations was our first focus on the automation product area.</p>\n<p>We gave users the ability to categorize automations, which makes the process of managing, editing, debugging, and searching automations much simpler. The categories are up to the users to define. For instance, I personally created categories per functionality such as “Smart Heating” or “Smart Cleaning”, and I particularly like my “Tests” categories where I keep all the automations that are currently being tested in my home.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-04/filter-panel.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Automations settings with filter panel\" /></p>\n<p>On top of categories, users can now attach labels to automations, just like any other entity found in Home Assistant. Labels can be used to filter the automation list further, but what I am most interested in is the automation capabilities of the labels themselves. I saw some great ideas in the community, one of them that struck me was the idea to label some automation as “Not Guest Friendly” and deactivate them when a guest mode was activated. It’s nice to see labels as a tool to automate everything, even your automations themselves. 😀</p>\n<p>All in all, Home Assistant truly made automations easier to organize in the past 6 months. We could still work on that, no opportunity is ever really done, but for the time being, we are considering this one done so that we can focus on bigger problems.</p>\n<h4>Newly in progress: Make automations easier to create</h4>\n<p>Automations are one of the cornerstones of Home Assistant, but it’s not an easy task to create them, especially if you are just starting out. There are a dozen things to know before you start and a dozen things to learn along the way.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-01/add-action-search.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new add action dialog utilizing the search function to find whatever you need.\">\n<p>Last year we redesigned our action picker and replaced a single option with an obscure name, <strong>“Call Service”</strong>, with hundreds of neatly categorized entries that we called <strong>“Actions”</strong>. This improved the automation creation process by quite a margin.</p>\n<p>Today, the automation editor feels like it has progressed at two different speeds; our actions are easy to use, but our triggers and conditions are not. So we have begun bringing the same level of convenience that we previously brought to actions to our beloved triggers and conditions.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to make our automation editor more approachable without losing what makes us unique: Its capabilities.</p>\n<h4>Later priority: Make blueprints easier to use</h4>\n<p>Blueprints are amazing, they represent what makes the Home Assistant community truly great: Sharing what you learned with others.</p>\n<p>We are aware that using (and sharing) blueprints is not the most straightforward process today. For now, this is the next opportunity we want to tackle inside the automation stream.</p>\n<h3>Dashboards</h3>\n<h4>In good shape: Make customization of dashboards easy and intuitive</h4>\n<p>With the stable release of the new Sections view layout in Home Assistant <a href=\"/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/\">2024.11</a>, our work on making customization of dashboards easier is now in good shape! The learning curve for creating nice dashboards has been vastly reduced, and we are seeing more and more people being interested in and being able to create high-quality dashboards that are usable for everyone in the household.</p>\n<p class='img no-shadow'><img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11/dashboard-conversion.png\"/>Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections</p>\n<p>Work will continue with the dashboard working group. The group is currently looking into standardizing the appearance of our default cards. <strong>Please <a href=\"/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/#process-how-can-we-work-together\">reach out to us</a> if you are a frontend developer</strong> who would like to contribute and be part of the journey!</p>\n<h4>Newly in progress: Make default dashboards more useful and relevant</h4>\n<p>Now that we’ve made customization of dashboards easier than ever, what’s next? We understand that it can be intimidating for users when they are faced with a blank slate. Some may be full of ideas on how they would like to fill their dashboards up, but some would prefer if Home Assistant came with something useful out-of-the-box. Therefore, we are now looking into making dashboards easier, even if you don’t know how to create one.</p>\n<p class='img'><img alt=\"Case studies of many dashboards of our users\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11-roadmap-2024h2/dashboard-casestudies.png\"/>Case studies of many dashboards of our users</p>\n<p>Over the past year, we have looked into dozens of case studies - dashboards created by many of you, from the most popular to the most pragmatic - and began to notice patterns in how our users organize their dashboards. Home Assistant is unique compared to other smart home platforms in that our dashboards are not just about controlling devices. After all, the perfect app is no app, as in, opening an app to control your light bulb is less convenient than simply flicking a light switch, or better yet, just automating it.</p>\n<p>What we see our users have built instead are dashboards that help them keep track of information for their daily lives at a glance, and keep a birds-eye view of everything that is going on around their homes. For example, while you can automate Home Assistant to notify you when energy usage is too high, or you can ask Assist the current power usage, our dashboards shine at data visualization and its ability to tell you lots of information you need by just glancing at it.</p>\n<p>Currently, our default dashboard simply dumps every single entity that a home has onto one page, making it wildly unmanageable as the smart home grows. While it can automatically group entities by areas, we have learned that areas are not the only way users look at their dashboard information. What we saw instead are dashboards that are specialized and focused on the functions of a home, such as energy usage, security and safety, and network status, on complex objects, such as a car and a 3D printer, or on information unrelated to the home itself, such as weather, neighborhood information, or even rocket launches. While we can simply show every entity by domain, we know we can make these function-focused dashboards much more useful by exposing insights by curating and juxtaposing information.</p>\n<h4>Next priority: Improve privacy in user, guest, and public access</h4>\n<p>The inability to fine-tune access to Home Assistant by guests or other members of the family has been a pain point requested by many of our users. We want to investigate ways to mitigate this while improving the privacy of the household. Our research on what privacy means to users will hopefully bring more clarity to this before we start working on it.</p>\n<h3>Voice Assistants</h3>\n<h4>In good shape: Improve Assist capabilities out of the box</h4>\n<p>Assist, our private voice assistant, received a lot of love over the last 6 months. Our first focus was to improve its capabilities out of the box, without needing to tinker with it. We added a lot of features that were heavily requested by the community, features that bring us one step closer to feature parity with our non-private competitors.</p>\n<p>We brought area awareness, which allows you to target devices in the same area without mentioning the area (like “Close the curtains” or “Turn off the lights”). We brought floor support, which allows you to target devices across areas on the same floor; very useful for homes with an open floor design (for example “Turn on all lights on the first floor”).</p>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"v3mNdTsX4J0\" videotitle=\"Voice timers with countdown text and loading bar\"></lite-youtube>Timers running on an S3 Box, with countdown text and a loading bar!</p>\n<p>We implemented timers, allowing any voice assistant device to “ring” when a timer ends, including supporting the creation of multiple timers. You can also pause and resume them and add or remove time from them. You can combine commands with timers by giving a delayed command, allowing you to perform an action after a specific amount of time (like “Turn off the TV in 30 minutes)”.</p>\n<p>We also brought the ability to control media via voice. Pausing or resuming them, controlling the volume, and going to the next track. This, combined with the area awareness capability mentioned above made for some really interesting short commands that work in a room with a TV playing or music streaming, such as “Pause”, “Resume” and “Next”.</p>\n<p>Finally, our on-device wake word engine called microWakeWord became much faster and much better at recognizing wake words. This is the result of using real voice data in the training process to fine-tune the models. With <a href=\"https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/\">Wake Word Collective</a>, you can now contribute by lending your voice to improve our community-driven, privacy-focused voice assistant! You can read more about it in <a href=\"/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/\">this blog post</a>.</p>\n<h4>In progress: Make Assist easier to start with</h4>\n<p>So Assist is more capable, but what about getting started with Voice?</p>\n<p>Voice is hard because it is a combination of great software and great hardware. Up until recently, we primarily focused on making the software experience great and relied on readily available hardware to power our voice assistants.</p>\n<p class='img'><img alt=\"A teaser of our voice hardware\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11-roadmap-2024h2/voice-hardware-teaser.jpg\"/>A teaser of our voice hardware</p>\n<p>However, this is changing - over the past 6 months, we have built our own hardware! It will be the first voice assistant hardware built from the ground up to work with Home Assistant, fully open source (firmware and hardware), and it is going to be released <em>very soon</em>. It is truly the missing hardware piece to a more approachable voice experience in Home Assistant, and we cannot wait to see what you will build with it.</p>\n<h4>Later priority: Make Assist more conversational</h4>\n<p>The more functionality we add to Assist, the more we reach its transactional limitations. Indeed, today, an interaction is one way, from a user (issuing a command) to Assist (acting on that command). We would like to improve this, allowing more conversational interactions with Assist.</p>\n<p>In the future, Assist will be able to ask for clarifications before fulfilling a command, such as requesting the duration of a timer if it was not part of the original command or asking for confirmation before processing critical actions, such as unlocking all doors. On top of that, we would like to allow the conversation to start from Assist, and not from the user, such as greeting someone when they enter a room.\nThis pairs very well with LLM-based conversation agents due to their ability to retain context, but we will make sure these types of complex interactions are also possible with our default conversation agent.</p>\n<h3>Research</h3>\n<h4>In good shape: Build local LLM infrastructure</h4>\n<p>In the past six months, we’ve introduced support for LLM local tools and <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#control-home-assistant-using-ai-with-ollama\">Ollama</a>, pushing our efforts to make AI more accessible and private for experimentation within Home Assistant. We’ve also dedicated significant effort to creating realistic benchmarks, focusing on natural, conversational use cases rather than edge cases. This approach lets us better understand performance and user experience in day-to-day interactions.</p>\n<p>Our latest benchmark for local language models (LLMs) can be explored <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports\">here</a>, showcasing how models like qwen2.5 perform in realistic settings. With these insights, we’re continuing to refine LLM integrations and to ensure that LLMs can be depended upon for common use cases at home.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-06-voice-chapter-7/voice-script.png' alt=\"Exposing voice scripts to Assist in Home Assistant Voice settings\" class='no-shadow'>\n<p>You can now expand LLM capabilities by <a href=\"/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#expand-an-llm-using-your-scripts\">allowing them access to your scripts</a>. This feature lets you precisely control what the LLM does in specific situations, while still benefiting from the flexibility and natural language processing that AIs excel at.</p>\n<h4>In progress: Investigate on privacy</h4>\n<p>Since our last roadmap update, we have expanded the product and design team working on the Home Assistant project, and we have hired our first ever dedicated user researcher!</p>\n<p>While we are ramping up our user research pipeline, we have started working on investigating what privacy means to our users. Of the three Open Home values, privacy, choice, and sustainability, while we have a pretty solid understanding of choice and some understanding of sustainability, the idea of privacy can benefit from more clarity. We have interviewed a handful of users on this topic recently, and we can’t wait to show you what we have found.</p>\n<h2>Home Assistant Cloud</h2>\n<p>Home Assistant Cloud, powered by our commercial partner Nabu Casa brings, to the many, the hard-to-reach features of Home Assistant usually reserved for power users with expensive hardware at home, with no compromise on privacy.</p>\n<p>In recent months, the Nabu Casa team has been hard at work in bringing peace of mind to using Home Assistant. For the cloud backup feature, the Home Assistant team and the Nabu Casa team are now working closely together on a comprehensive revamp of backup integrations, to create an easy one-stop solution to a good backup strategy. We are also working to ensure users have a smooth onboarding for backing up to Home Assistant Cloud, as well as other third-party backup locations.</p>\n<p>The team had to postpone some features in favor of others like <a href=\"/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#low-latency-cameras-using-webrtc\">WebRTC</a>. They had successfully released the infrastructure needed to support WebRTC, both STUN servers for every Home Assistant user and TURN servers for every Home Assistant Cloud subscriber, enhancing real-time communication capabilities within Home Assistant. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is one of the postponed features, but it is still in the Nabu Casa pipeline.</p>\n<h2>Open Protocols</h2>\n<p>We remain committed to supporting open smart home standards, including Z-Wave Zigbee, Matter, and Thread, aligning with our Open Home mission to offer choice, privacy, and sustainability through locally controlled, cloud-independent devices.</p>\n<p>In the past six months, we have made significant steps towards certifications, ensuring our open standards implementations are up to industry standards.</p>\n<h3>Z-Wave</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/blog/2024/09/24/we-are-joining-the-z-wave-alliance-board/\">September</a>, Paulus, the founder of Home Assistant, announced his new role on the Z-Wave Alliance Board of Directors, representing Nabu Casa. Serving on the board will allow Nabu Casa to contribute meaningfully to Z-Wave’s development and ensure that the needs of Home Assistant users and open-source values are represented.</p>\n<p>As interest in Z-Wave devices in our ecosystem continues to grow, this has driven Home Assistant to advance the Z-Wave JS stack and create its own Z-Wave hardware. While we are working on the <a href=\"/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead\">certification of our Z-Wave implementation</a>, our work on building our own Z-Wave antenna has also been progressing smoothly. We base the design of our antenna on the <a href=\"https://github.com/drzwave/ZRAD\">Z-Wave Reference Application Design</a> to create a Z-Wave antenna with the best performance in the market.</p>\n<h3>Matter</h3>\n<p>As one of the first in the industry, in June, we proudly announced that Home Assistant is now based on the <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#matter-turns-13\">latest Matter 1.3 specification</a>. Since then, we continued to update our Matter implementation to improve the reliability and compatibility of Matter devices, and Matter certification should hopefully happen any day now soon!</p>\n<p>We have brought expanded device support and performance improvements to Home Assistant’s Matter integration. Air purifiers, room air conditioners, and thermostats are now better supported, along with custom clusters, which allow Home Assistant to detect data changes in real-time, improving network efficiency.</p>\n<p>Update entities now provide firmware updates via official Matter update channels, while event entities provide more event types, allowing you to react to single-press or double-press events with ease. Additional features include water valve support, operation state tracking for appliances, and smoke and CO sensor integration. Matter 1.3 power and energy sensors are also supported, providing useful data for the energy dashboard.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we will continue to work on Matter 1.4 compatibility, as well as making device commissioning easier and working with Thread credentials. We have made major strides forward and hopefully we will be able to get through some of our roadblocks soon.</p>\n<h3>Zigbee</h3>\n<p>The Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA) integration got a massive overhaul <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#zigbee-home-automation-zha-updates\">during Summer</a>. The whole integration has been split into a separate codebase, making it easier to maintain and improve. This is a huge step forward for the integration, and took months of work to get done. This change will make the integration easier to maintain and improve in the future, including allowing code contributors to contribute more easily.</p>\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<p>We hope that you can feel the results of all this work.  Given the positive feedback we have received from our users, we will continue to follow our roadmap to work on the next product initiatives.</p>\n<p>We will also start preparing for the roadmap for next year. It will have a new theme, and we would like to have our community be more involved in the process of its creation. Planning has already begun, and we hope to announce it at the next State of the Open Home. Last but not the least, please get in the comments and give us your feedback - we read it all!</p>\n<p>See you next year!</p>\n<p>- <a href=\"https://github.com/Madelena\">Madelena</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/jlpouffier\">JLo</a></p>\n",

You might\nhave heard this already, but going to share it again:</p>\n<p><em><strong>We are number one!</strong> 🥇</em></p>\n<p>GitHub published its annual <a href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/\">Octoverse report</a>, highlighting the platform’s\nbiggest trends and projects. It named Home Assistant 2024’s largest open-source\nproject, with over 21,000 contributors over the year. <strong>That includes you! ❤️</strong></p>\n<p>Continuing the festivities, this release is a big one! The new dashboarding\nsystem we have been working on all year is now out of its experimental phase\nand generally available! 🥳 Exciting, <strong>everyone</strong> can now create beautiful\ndashboards with ease!</p>\n<p>To top it off, this release also supports faster and lower-latency camera\nstreams using WebRTC, supported by the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>.\nThis is a huge improvement! 🎉</p>\n<p>Enjoy the release!</p>\n<p>../Frenck</p>\n<!--more-->\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#sections-dashboard-no-longer-experimental\">Sections dashboard no longer experimental!</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#convert-your-old-dashboards-to-sections-view-layout\">Convert your old dashboards to sections view layout</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#precise-mode-for-card-sizes\">Precise mode for card sizes</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#low-latency-cameras-using-webrtc\">Low latency cameras using WebRTC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#integrations\">Integrations</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#new-integrations\">New integrations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#noteworthy-improvements-to-existing-integrations\">Noteworthy improvements to existing integrations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui\">Now available to set up from the UI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#farewell-to-the-following\">Farewell to the following</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#other-noteworthy-changes\">Other noteworthy changes</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#live-logs\">Live logs</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#voice\">Voice</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#home-assistant-intents-improvements\">Home Assistant intents improvements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#join-the-wake-word-collective\">Join the Wake Word Collective</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#patch-releases\">Patch releases</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#2024111---november-8\">2024.11.1 - November 8</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#2024112---november-15\">2024.11.2 - November 15</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#2024113---november-22\">2024.11.3 - November 22</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#need-help-join-the-community\">Need help?

The sections view layout,\ntogether with its drag-and-drop 🐲 capabilities and responsive design,\nis now <strong>out of its experimental phase</strong>, and ready for primetime! This means\nthat, as of this release, you will get our awesome feature-rich and easy-to-use\ndashboard editing experience when you create a new dashboard. 🎉</p>\n<p>Over the past few months, we have worked hard to iterate and listen to your\nfeedback to ensure that our new dashboard is easy to customize for both\nbeginners and advanced users alike. We have added new capabilities such as\n<a href=\"/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/\">resizing cards</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/\">visibility options</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2024/09/04/release-20249/\">wider sections</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/\">new badges</a>,\nand, most recently, adding <a href=\"/blog/2024/10/02/release-202410/\">the new heading card</a>.</p>\n<p>To finish this journey, we are adding two more features to this release.</p>\n<h3>Convert your old dashboards to sections view layout</h3>\n<p class='img no-shadow'><img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11/dashboard-conversion.png\"/>Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections</p>\n<p>This release includes a way to convert individual dashboard views from the old\nmasonry view layout to the new sections view layout. When you change the view\ntype to sections, you get a button to convert the view. All the cards of the\nold view are then copied and placed in an imported cards section in the new\nview, and you can then easily drag-and-drop them into the right sections.</p>\n<p>Please note that cards placed within the imported cards section are only visible\nto users once moved to a section above the fold. This ensures that\ncards do not get accidentally shown in the wrong sections while you are still\nworking on the dashboard.</p>\n<p class='img no-shadow'><img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the imported cards section\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11/imported-cards.png\"/>Screenshot of the imported cards section</p>\n<p>If you are not ready for the new layout yet, no worries! Your old dashboard view\nis kept when a new dashboard is created, giving an excellent way for masonry\nview veterans to try out sections while keeping all the hard work they have put\ninto customizing their cards.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can move each card one-by-one from another view. All moved\ncards will also be temporarily placed in the imported cards section.</p>\n<h3>Precise mode for card sizes</h3>\n<p class='img no-shadow'><img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Examples of cards using precise mode\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11/precise-mode-example.png\" style=\"width: 60%;\"/>Examples of cards using precise mode</p>\n<p>If you love tinkering with your dashboards and fine-tuning card sizes with more\nprecision, you now have even more control over the size of cards. In the layout\noptions of a card you can now enable “Precise mode”, which will give you three\ntimes more options for the card widths!</p>\n<p>Precise mode is applied on a card-by-card level. While a normal section is\ndivided into 4 columns, precise modes gives you 12 columns, which allows you\nto align 2, 3, 4, or 6 buttons side-by-side.</p>\n<h2>Low latency cameras using WebRTC</h2>\n<p>Lots of effort has gone into this new and amazing feature for this release:\n<strong>WebRTC</strong>! 🎉</p>\n<center><p class='no-shadow'><img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Logo of WebRTC\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11/webrtc-logo-horiz-retro.png\" /></p></center>\n<p>Not sure <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC\">what WebRTC is</a>? No worries! Let us try to explain. If you are\nwatching a camera in Home Assistant, you might have noticed it is sometimes\na bit slow and delayed. WebRTC support is going to change that!</p>\n<p>Camera streams will now try to use WebRTC whenever possible.\n<a href=\"https://webrtc.org/\">WebRTC is a standard</a> that makes a peer-to-peer connection for lower-latency\naudio and video streaming. You are probably using this technology a lot already,\nfor example, when having an online video call. When you’re away from home,\nit will try to find the fastest and most direct path between your Home Assistant\ninstance and the camera you are trying to view.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">The Open Home Foundation</a> will host the negotiating network infrastructure\n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN\">STUN servers</a>) <strong>for free for all Home Assistant users</strong> and enable the\ncapability to use WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections whenever possible. If you are using Home Assistant OS or our containers, after you update this will automatically work out of the box.</p>\n<center><p class='no-shadow'><img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Logo of the Open Home Foundation\" src=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/assets/images/logo/open-home-foundation.svg\" style=\"width: 90%\" /></p></center>\n<p>Sometimes, a direct connection between the client (like your browser\nor mobile app) and the camera is not possible; in those situations, the camera\nstream needs to be relayed by an external server. <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> now\nprovides this relay server (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT\">TURN server</a>), and it’s <strong>included as one of the many benefits</strong>\navailable to all subscribers!</p>\n<p>So, no matter where you are, you should always be able to watch your cameras\nvia this low-latency technology. If, for whatever reason, WebRTC is not\navailable, it will fall back to using the old method of streaming to ensure\nyou can always see your camera feeds.</p>\n<p>So, after reading all of this, what changed? Well, camera feeds will do everything they did before, but will be faster, more responsive, and less delayed! 🎉</p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

This allows MQTT devices to be set up\nand discovered once instead of separately for each entity; which is much\nmore efficient. Nice improvement!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>\n<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant\nuser interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving\nmore integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone\nto set up and use.</p>\n<p>The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/integrations/local_file\">Local file</a></strong>, done by <a href=\"https://github.com/gjohansson-ST\">@gjohansson-ST</a></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/integrations/onkyo\">Onkyo</a></strong>, done by <a href=\"https://github.com/Nebula83\">@Nebula83</a></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/integrations/smarty\">Smarty</a></strong>, done by <a href=\"https://github.com/joostlek\">@joostlek</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>\n<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are also no longer available as\nof this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bloomsky</strong>. Their service shut down.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Domains</strong>. The domain registration service by Google has been\nshut down.</li>\n<li><strong>Spider</strong>. The service is no longer available.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>\n<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other\nnoteworthy changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/integrations/image\">Image entities</a> now have a snapshot action, allowing you to save the current\nimage in the entity to a file. Nice <a href=\"https://github.com/NickM-27\">@NickM-27</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Petro31\">@Petro31</a> added <a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#limited-templates\">(limited) template</a> support to the “at” field of <a href=\"/docs/automation/trigger/#time-trigger\">time triggers</a>.\nThis allows you to template the time of that trigger in, for example,\na blueprint automation.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile\">Nautical miles</a> (<code>nmi</code>) is now a valid distance unit. This means you can now\nuse this as a unit for your distance sensors. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/mib1185\">@mib1185</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetele\">@tetele</a> added <a href=\"/integrations/template/#using-blueprints\">blueprints for template entities</a>! This allows for easier\nre-use and sharing of common blueprints for sets of templated entities.\nThis is an advanced feature and is only available using manual YAML\nconfiguration.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/MindFreeze\">@MindFreeze</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/matthiasdebaat\">@matthiasdebaat</a> have improved the network settings user\ninterface. It is now easier to manage and configure your network settings,\nincluding nicer handling of IP addresses, improved Wi-Fi configuration,\nand better visibility on the URLs Home Assistant is using for your instance.</li>\n<li>We now indicate if a custom integration is overriding a built-in integration.\nThis makes it easier to spot if a custom integration is taking over a\nbuilt-in integration while you are wondering why you didn’t get the latest\nfeatures Home Assistant releases bring. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/MindFreeze\">@MindFreeze</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Live logs</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, if something does not work as expected, you might resort to a more technical\ntool for finding out what is going on: The logs.</p>\n<p>Previously, if you looked at the logs of, for example, an add-on or the Home\nAssistant Supervisor, you would only see the last 100 log lines. You would\nhave had to refresh the page to see new log entries.</p>\n<p>Well, no more! As of this release, the logs are now <strong>streaming live</strong>! 🎉</p>\n<p class='img no-shadow'><img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the imported cards section\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-11/streaming-live-logs.gif\"/>Screen recording demonstrating logs showing up as they happen.</p>\n<p>And not just that, you can scroll back in time to see previous log items.\nThat’s a pretty cool improvement. 😎</p>\n<h2>Voice</h2>\n<p>Last year, 2023, was the <a href=\"/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/\">Year of the Voice</a> for Home Assistant. And while this\nyear isn’t specifically dedicated to voice, everyone is still working hard\ntowards the goal of letting users control their homes with their voice in\ntheir own language.</p>\n<p>As you might have heard through many community channels 🕵️‍♀️, we are working to\nmake this a reality for everyone. We are hard at work getting our Home Assistant\nvoice satellite hardware ready and available for selling and shipping! 🤗</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more information on that soon!</p>\n<h3>Home Assistant intents improvements</h3>\n<p>One of the things we are working on is the Home Assistant intents. This is a\nway for a voice assistant to understand the intention behind your spoken\nsentences. This is a very crucial part of a local voice assistant.</p>\n<p>In this release, we decided to align and combine Canadian French and French languages for the time being. Though we understand it is a unique dialect, this is about giving Canadian French users a lot more voice features.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-11/canadian-french-on-assist.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a few commands in Canadian French before and after this release\" /></p>\n<p>These intents are built and maintained by the community, and we are very\ngrateful for their work. For example, <a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya\">@piitaya</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jlpouffier\">@jlpouffier</a> have made a\ngreat effort to lead the French language intents mentioned above.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, we want to ensure everyone can use Home Assistant in their\nown language, <strong>so we need your help</strong>! Help the community by contributing to\nthe intents for your language. You can find more information on how to do that\nin our <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/contributing\">developer documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Join the Wake Word Collective</h3>\n<p>Another essential part of voice is the Wake Word! And this is where <strong>everyone</strong>,\nno matter your skill level, can help out with just a minute of your time!</p>\n<p>Wake words are the words you say to wake up your voice assistant. For example,\n<em>“Hey Google”</em> or <em>“Alexa”</em>. As we are building our own voice assistant with\nour own wake words, we need to train our models to recognize these words,\nregardless of your accent, language, gender, or age.</p>\n<p>So, get your whole home involved 🏠! Take a minute to help us out by recording your voice\nsaying the wake word. It is super easy, and you can do it right from your\nbrowser or mobile, no need to install anything!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/\"><strong>Help us improve our wake words today! ❤️</strong></a></p>\n<p>You can read more about the Wake Word Collective in our\n<a href=\"/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/\">dedicated blog post</a>.</p>\n<h2>Patch releases</h2>\n<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.11 in November.\nThese patch releases only contain bug fixes.

Our open source <a href=\"https://github.com/kahrendt/microWakeWord\">microWakeWord</a> engine is an incredible, lightweight bit of code but requires training with real voices to improve. Everyone’s voice is unique, and we need recordings of people of all genders, ages, and accents from around the world saying this wake word. So get the whole home involved, along with friends and family.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/\"><strong>Help us today</strong></a></p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Your voice, your choice</h2>\n<p>Privacy is at the core of everything we do, and that’s what’s driving us to build an open, local, and private voice assistant. Years ago a voice assistant arms race began between a couple of big tech companies, where they sold very cheap voice hardware, all because they wanted your data. They used that voice data to rapidly improve their voice capabilities (and who knows what else) at <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47893082\">the expense of your privacy</a>.</p>\n<p>We will never use those tactics to improve Home Assistant. We do something novel and bewildering to the smart home industry - we explicitly ask for your help. For instance, Home Assistant has <a href=\"https://analytics.home-assistant.io/\">opt-in statistics</a>; these really help us focus on what people are using and put resources into making the biggest impact. When you <a href=\"/integrations/analytics/\">opt-in it really helps</a>, but we totally understand if you don’t - it’s your home and your data. We’re doing the same with voice, explicitly asking for help, and would love your help to improve its wake word capability.</p>\n<p>What big tech might consider a weakness is actually our greatest strength - privacy empowers our users, allowing them to not worry about being tracked or classified by an algorithm.</p>\n<h2>microWakeWord goes global</h2>\n<p>microWakeWord is a very lightweight wake word engine that can run on ESP32-class devices. This allows the voice assistant to listen for a specific phrase, for instance “Okay Nabu”, and ignore all other noise and speech until it hears that. Running it on-device speeds everything up significantly, cutting out the lag from streaming audio continuously to a more powerful device running wake word software. The downside to running it on-device is the amount of training required to get good results.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, we promoted an early version of this Wake Word Collective tool in the Open Home Foundation newsletter (<a href=\"https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/\">subscribe if you haven’t already</a>). From that one email alone, we received over 5,800 samples covering 30 different languages. While microWakeWord used to only excel at picking up the English pronunciation of “Okay Nabu”, it’s now many times more effective at picking up different accents. Our testing shows our model trained on this data falsely rejects 5% of samples, while previous models rejected 18%, which shows your samples are making a difference!</p>\n<p>We still need more different types of voices from different parts of the world. If you or your family use Assist and find it still struggling to wake up to hear your commands, this is the perfect opportunity to lend your voice to the project.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Before you start recording you will fill in what language you’re most comfortable speaking, allowing us to train language-specific wake word models that are better at detecting subtle differences in pronunciation. You must also read and agree to the <a href=\"https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/terms.html\">Wake Word Collective terms</a>. This explains, among other things, that these recordings will be made available publicly under a Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication. We operate our research openly for the benefit of all, and that is why these will be available to the public.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-10-wake-word-collective/demo.gif' alt=\"Animation showing how to use the wake word collective tool\">\n<p>Next, it explains that you only need you to say two words,  “Okay, Nabu”, a couple of times.  You’ll need to set down your phone, tablet, or laptop, and walk around the room, saying the wake word whenever the circle on the screen turns green.

      "Content": "<img src='/images/blog/2024-10-zbt1-issue/art.jpg' alt=\"Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 issue and replacement\">\n<p>We’ve found an issue in Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 that has affected a small number of customers, which appears to be the result of a faulty part incorporated in the first production run of ZBT-1 devices. We want to make sure everyone can get a replacement ZBT-1 and ensure they are covered far into the future.</p>\n<p>Though Home Assistant SkyConnect is identical to the ZBT-1 under the hood, it is not affected. The design is not what’s at fault, but instead, a defective voltage regulator that was used in this specific production run that is causing the issue. When a ZBT-1 is inserted into certain USB-A ports, the voltage regulator can fail, fully bricking the device. We used high-quality manufacturing and quality control in this and previous production runs. We are undertaking an investigation to find out how this could happen and most importantly, to avoid a repeat of anything remotely similar in the future.</p>\n<p>We’re sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you. Below are details on our investigation, how devices are affected, and the replacement program.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#pausing-sales\">Pausing sales</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#replacement-program\">Replacement Program</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Around a month ago, we were contacted about one of our latest (and <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/13/zbt1-annoucement/\">recently rebranded</a>) Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1s not being detected and showing a small mark on the housing. A couple more similar issues were reported, and we began a dialogue with the small number of people who were affected, having them send us the devices to test.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-10-zbt1-issue/zbt1-issue.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"ZBT-1 case deformation and faulty voltage regulator\">Circled in red the deformation on the case and the board showing the failed chip</p>\n<p>When we opened them, we found a dead voltage regulator. The mark in the outer casing is a sign that it overheated and failed. All of our devices are certified by CE and ROHS, and the plastic shell has been designed not to combust. This is a real-life demonstration of just how important this certification is and why we take that step.</p>\n<p>We replaced the voltage regulator on the devices we tested, and the devices sprang back to life. We found our culprit, but why was it failing? As mentioned, the SkyConnect internal design and the manufacturing were effectively identical to the ZBT-1, and we received no reports of any such failures in the literally tens of thousands of them in the wild. In manufacturing runs there is always a little variance, and in this run, something went wrong with the voltage regulator that was sourced - again, we’re looking into this.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-10-zbt1-issue/skyconnect-zbt1.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"SkyConnect (left) and ZBT-1 (right)\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 0.9rem;\">SkyConnect (left) and ZBT-1 (right) branded devices, SkyConnect are unaffected by this issue.</p>\n<p>It took us a couple of weeks to replicate the problem with our own units. We went down some wrong paths, but eventually found it was triggered only by certain devices, specifically certain desktop PCs (internally, we have only found one desktop that causes this failure). We have not observed the failure occur when the device has only been connected to a Home Assistant Green, Raspberry Pi, or even a Mac. If you have plugged your ZBT-1 into a different device, specifically a desktop PC, and it is not recognized by that system, inspect it for this deformation pictured above. Obviously, we want you to be able to use the device with any hardware, and even if only a small number of devices from this production run have reported issues, it is still unacceptable to us.</p>\n<h2>Pausing sales</h2>\n<p>We have asked our distributors to pause sales and return all stock. For the next month, you will see “Out of Stock” banners, and if you are attempting to get a replacement device for a failed unit, this will not be possible until production is resumed.</p>\n<p>We are working to have replacement ZBT-1s shipped by early November.</p>\n<h2>Replacement Program</h2>\n<p>If you have purchased Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1, we are working on a replacement program. This program will see Nabu Casa provide a replacement device free of charge for a period of 60 months (5 years) for verified purchases. Regardless of whether the device has failed, we will provide a replacement upon request.</p>\n<p>It is a core value of ours to do things as sustainably as possible, and that’s why we’ve provided such a long coverage period. We want to give owners with working ZBT-1s, who do not expect to use the device in a different system for the foreseeable future, the ability to keep it operating with peace of mind.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-note\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>\n  <p class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>All ZBT-1 branded devices produced, as of October 2024, are believed to have this fault. You can tell if your device is a ZBT-1 by checking the white label on the back for “ZBT-1”. There is no need to test if your device is affected by this fault.</p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>If it’s working, keep it plugged into the device it’s working with, and don’t worry about a replacement until you need it. If you need or want a replacement, please contact the seller where you purchased your device, and they will arrange the return process and replacement. Replacement devices are expected by early November, and we will be prioritizing people with non-functioning devices.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We’re sorry for the inconvenience and any disruption to your smart home. As someone who uses Zigbee in their home, which many smart devices rely on, I would hate to have it out of commission.</p>\n<p>Worse things can happen, but this has been a gut punch. All our work at Nabu Casa is to fund the development of Home Assistant and support the Open Home. Issues like this eat into our time, and rob our users of new and great things. Ultimately, we’re going to take this setback as a chance to prove we stand by our values and do the right thing.</p>\n",

It allows you to add titles or\nsubtitles to your dashboards, make them clickable, and even add cute little\nentities to them. The new section dashboard gets better and better with every\nrelease, which is super exciting!</p>\n<p>We also introduce some small YAML automation syntax changes.

Section titles are replaced with their own card,\ncalled the <a href=\"/dashboards/heading/\">heading card</a>. Making them a card rather than an inline title gives\nyou a lot more flexibility, allowing you to put them nearly anywhere.</p>\n<p>The heading card can be used to make titles, but also subtitles, which are half\nthe height and have smaller, lighter text. So, if you have ever had a section\nthat needs to be subdivided, slap a subtitle in there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-10/headings.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a dashboard using heading cards with titles and subtitles\" /></p>\n<p>Titles and subtitles can be made clickable, displaying a chevron\n<iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:chevron-right'></iconify-icon> when you can interact with them. This can\nperform an action or navigate to a subpage, like having an energy section title\nnavigate to the full energy dashboard.</p>\n<p>Best of all, if you’ve already added titles to your sections, they will be\nmigrated automatically to the new card. 😎</p>\n<h3>Another headline feature</h3>\n<p>We had such a fantastic reaction when we released our <a href=\"/dashboards/badges/\">renewed badges</a>,\nand this new heading card has something very similar and equally as visually\nappealing. It can show multiple entity states to the right of the title or\nsubtitle.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-10/heading-with-entities.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a dashboard with additional entities shown on card headings\" /></p>\n<p>Either in a subtle “no color” default or add a splash of color when the entity\nis in an active state. Other customization options for these entities include\nchanging the icon, visibility, and what happens when you select it.</p>\n<h2>Repairs for long-term statistics</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://data.home-assistant.io/docs/statistics/\">Long-term statistics</a> are great; they downsample and store the data produced\nby your <span class='terminology'>sensors<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Sensors return information about a thing, for instance the level of water in a tank.<a class='terminology-link' href='/integrations/sensor/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>, allowing Home Assistant to store data indefinitely\nin a fraction of the space the original readings took up. Take a look back at\n<a href=\"/docs/energy/\">your energy usage</a> from two years ago, or see if your living room really is\ncolder this year compared to last.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-10/statistics-repair.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a long-term statistic repair showing up in the settings menu\" /></p>\n<p>In the past, if a statistic encountered an issue, it might be quietly broken\nuntil you dig into the statistics page. Now, Home Assistant will raise a repair\nnotification when it detects issues with a long-term statistic and give\nyou options for fixing the issue.</p>\n<h2>Improved YAML syntax for automations</h2>\n<p>Recently, we renamed <code>service</code> to <code>action</code> in the <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#goodbye-service-calls-hello-actions-\">Home Assistant UI and YAML</a>.\nThis was done with the goal of making the syntax more natural, allowing it\nto be easier to grasp and read. We want to continue this work to improve the\n<span class='terminology'>YAML<span class='terminology-tooltip'>YAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the <code>configuration.yaml</code> or <code>automations.yaml</code> files.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/yaml/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> syntax, this time focusing on <span class='terminology'>automations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Automations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>, and we’ve made the\nfollowing changes,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The top-level <code>trigger</code> key is now <code>triggers</code> (plural)</li>\n<li>The top-level <code>condition</code> key is now <code>conditions</code> (plural)</li>\n<li>The top-level <code>action</code> key is now <code>actions</code> (plural)</li>\n<li>The <code>platform</code> key of a trigger definition is now <code>trigger</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result of all this is that YAML automation syntax now has <code>triggers</code> with\nmultiple <code>trigger</code> definitions, <code>conditions</code> with multiple <code>condition</code>\ndefinitions, and <code>actions</code> with multiple <code>action</code> definitions.</p>\n<p>Here is a small example of an automation highlighting these changes.</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-10/YAML-automation-syntax-changes.png\" alt=\"Screenshots; left showing the old automation YAML style, right showing the new style. The differences between them have been highlighted.\">\nThe 2024.9 release on the left and this 2024.10 release on the right.\n</p>\n<p>As with the other syntax changes we’ve done recently, this is\n<strong>not a breaking change</strong>, and there will be no deprecation. The previous syntax\nwill continue to work, and there are no plans to remove the old syntax. The new\nsyntax is recommended, and all documentation and examples have been updated.\nAutomations managed by the automation editor will automatically be migrated to\nthe new syntax when saving an automation.</p>\n<p>This is not the only change to our syntax, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a> we now support\n<a href=\"/docs/automation/trigger/#merging-lists-of-triggers\">merging a list of triggers</a>, which is mostly useful for\n<span class='terminology'>blueprint<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A blueprint is a script, automation or template entity configuration with certain parts marked as configurable. This allows users to create multiple scripts, automations or template entities based on the same blueprint, with each having its own configuration-specific settings.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/blueprint/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> authors.</p>\n<h2>Faster upgrades when using custom integrations</h2>\n<p>We want Home Assistant to continue to work on a wide range of hardware. If you\nlook at our <a href=\"https://analytics.home-assistant.io/\">opt-in analytics</a> you’ll see a sizable amount of homes running it\non single-board computers from the mid-2010s. A lot of effort has been put into\nkeeping Home Assistant lean, and this release has some good improvements. This\nis specially for users of custom integrations, and this follows HACS getting a\ngreat <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/21/hacs-the-best-way-to-share-community-made-projects/#faster-downloads\">speed boost for downloads</a>.</p>\n<p>On each upgrade, all dependencies needed for <span class='terminology'>custom integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A custom integration is an integration that has been created by someone from the Home Assistant community and has been published for others to use at their own risk. Custom integrations are not supported by the Home Assistant project. They are not reviewed or tested by the Home Assistant development team and thus may negatively impact the stability of your Home Assistant instance. An example of a custom integration is the <a href=\"https://spook.boo/\">Spook</a> integration.</span></span>\nare now downloaded and installed. We are now using <code>uv</code> internally to download\nand install dependencies, which is a faster and more efficient way to download\nand install dependencies. If you’re not aware, <code>uv</code> is what makes our release\nprocess so fast nowadays, and <a href=\"https://github.com/edenhaus\">@edenhaus</a> has done an interesting\n<a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/04/03/build-images-with-uv/\">developer backstory</a> on our move from <code>pip</code> to <code>uv</code> (saving us 200+ hours\nof execution time a month). <a href=\"https://github.com/edenhaus\">@edenhaus</a> has also implemented <code>uv</code> at runtime\nas well.</p>\n<p>This speeds up the upgrade process, especially for custom integrations with many\ndependencies, or installations with many custom integrations. This change is\nfully transparent to the user, and no action is required. Just sit down, relax,\nand enjoy the faster upgrade process!</p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

For\nexample, to identify a device or reset the filter state.</li>\n<li><strong>Valve entities</strong><br />\nSupport for water valves, allowing you to control the flow of fluids or gases.</li>\n<li><strong>Support for operation states</strong><br />\nControl and monitor the operation state of, for example, dishwashers\nand other household equipment.</li>\n<li><strong>Support for smoke and CO sensors</strong><br />\nMonitor the air quality in your home with smoke and CO sensors.</li>\n<li><strong>Add support for Matter 1.3 power/energy sensors</strong><br />\nEspecially the energy sensors are great to use with the energy dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>\n<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other\nnoteworthy changes this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In June, we added support for adding <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/07/16/device-info-model-id\">Model IDs to devices</a>. This release\nhas lots of integrations that add them, including <a href=\"/integrations/matter\">Matter</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/plugwise\">Plugwise</a>,\n<a href=\"/integrations/wallbox\">Wallbox</a>, and <a href=\"/integrations/govee_light_local\">Govee</a>. We are calling for contributions to add model IDs to\nmore integrations! Maybe a cool suggestion for an <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/\">Hacktoberfest</a> contribution!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bmesuere\">@bmesuere</a> improved the accessibility of all graphs by adjusting all the\ndefault colors used in those graphs! You are a hero!</li>\n<li>When you unignore an integration or device on the integrations page,\nHome Assistant will instantly try to rediscover it again! Nice! Thanks,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/emontnemery\">@emontnemery</a>!</li>\n<li>We now have a new unit of measurement for energy entities: calories. Useful,\nfor devices like a treadmill or an exercise bike. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/dudanov\">@dudanov</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TrevorSchirmer\">@TrevorSchirmer</a> did something similar, and added a new unit of speed:\nmm/s and in/s. Thank you!</li>\n<li>When you rename a device, you will now see more details about the rename\noperation. Including a preview of the new entity IDs. Nice, <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gjohansson-ST\">@gjohansson-ST</a> added a new template function <a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#merge-action-responses\"><code>merge_response</code></a> that\nallows you to merge multiple responses of a single action or multiple actions\ninto a single response. Nice!</li>\n<li><a href=\"/integrations/template/#trigger-based-template-binary-sensors-buttons-images-numbers-selects-and-sensors\">Trigger-based templates</a> now have support for adding conditions! Just like\nautomations, you can now add conditions to these entities to control when\nthey are rendered. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/chammp\">@chammp</a>!</li>\n<li>More template fun! You can now set up your templated alarm control panel\nstraight from the UI. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/gjohansson-ST\">@gjohansson-ST</a>!</li>\n<li>The statistics developer tools have been improved. They now have the new-style\ndata tables and the ability to bulk select items to action. Awesome <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a>!</li>\n<li>There is a new entity in town, the <a href=\"/integrations/assist_satellite/\"><code>assist satellite</code> entity</a>.\nIt is a building block for remote satellites devices that use <a href=\"/voice_control\">Assist</a>. This\nis in preparation for our upcoming satellite hardware. Stay tuned!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The source of a repair</h3>\n<p><span class='terminology'>Integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can raise issues in your repairs dashboard, they can\nraise issues for themselves, but also for other integrations. An example of\nsuch an issue is an integration that connects to your device that raises an\nissue on an <span class='terminology'>automation<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Automations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that controls it.</p>\n<p>The result is an automation issue in your repair center. This is cool, but\nyou might want to know which integration raised the issue in the first place.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/wendevlin\">@wendevlin</a>, we now show the source integration of the repair issue\nin the issue dialog.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-10/repair-issue-reported-by.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new repairs dialog reporting the integration that raised it.\">\n<h3>YAML-editor improvements</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/naps62\">@naps62</a> has been busy improving the YAML editor found in the Home Assistant\nuser interface.</p>\n<p>We now have a vertical line based on indentation, which makes it easier to see\nthe indentation of your YAML configuration and allows you to spot and prevent\nindentation errors.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-10/YAML-editor-improvements.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the YAML editor with collapsed sections and the vertical indentation line.\">\n<p>But he didn’t stop there. You can now collapse and expand sections of your\nYAML configuration based on the indentation level; which is also demonstrated\nin the screenshot above.</p>\n<p>Nice work <a href=\"https://github.com/naps62\">@naps62</a>!</p>\n<h2>Patch releases</h2>\n<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.10 in October. These\npatch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch release\nevery Friday.</p>\n<h3>2024.10.1 - October 4</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix device id support for alarm control panel template (<a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya\">@piitaya</a> -

This is a significant piece of recognition for the work we have put into our support of open standards, and the importance of open source projects in keeping standards successful and thriving.</p>\n<p>Being part of this board allows us to play a bigger role in shaping Z-Wave’s future. As a <a href=\"https://z-wavealliance.org/z-wave-alliance-formalizes-standards-development-organization-and-announces-founding-members/\">Standards Development Organization (SDO)</a> the Alliance is shaped by its members, and they brought us in for our connection to our community and expertise in open source. We will be giving a voice to Home Assistant users, open source development, and Open Home Foundation values.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>A tenth of households with Home Assistant are using Z-Wave today, accounting for an estimated 1.7 million Z-Wave devices. We’ve seen a growing interest in Z-Wave in the Home Assistant community. This is why we have been driving forward the development of the open source <a href=\"https://github.com/zwave-js\">Z-Wave JS</a> stack, while also developing our own <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead/#range-testing-our-z-wave-stick-prototype\">Z-Wave connectivity hardware</a>.</p>\n<p>As you might be well aware, we’re very keen on open standards and are continuing to put a lot of work into supporting Zigbee, Matter, Thread, and Z-Wave. These standards are important for a number of reasons that align with our <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/about/\">Open Home mission</a>.</p>\n<p>These standards enable greater choice, giving our users access to decades of smart home devices to add to their homes. These standards are locally controlled and don’t rely on the cloud, meaning when devices are connected through Home Assistant they provide privacy out-of-the-box. Finally, there are a lot of these devices already in use in our homes, along with second-hand devices ready for a new home. Keeping a standard alive, keeps these devices alive and using what already exists is always the most sustainable option.</p>\n<p>This is not the only example of our work being recognized by these standards organizations. Recently, the Thread Group selected Nabu Casa for an <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thread-group_threadgroup-internetofthings-smarthome-activity-7226619123235971072-8kHn\">Innovation Enabler Award</a>, which is only awarded to two companies a year, and recognizes the “creative potential of [our] ideas and the use of Thread technology”.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead/\">We believe in Z-Wave</a> and we will continually push it to align with the Open Home, so it can bring better choice, privacy, and sustainability to the home.

That’s why we decided this year to focus our anniversary celebration on acknowledging and thanking our amazing community.

Together they threw a barrage of questions at <a href=\"https://github.com/frenck\">Frenck</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/balloob\">myself</a> - we didn’t see any of them ahead of time so our responses don’t get any more real than that. It was a lot of fun, and there was even a little announcement slipped in there, so <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE8yFUvQ2e4\">please check it out</a>.</p>\n<p>We can’t thank our community enough for the past 11 years. You are the engine driving forward Home Assistant. You put in your spare time to test, fix, build, and share your ideas. You fund our work by subscribing to <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, which allows us to devote our full attention to you, and never have to answer to a bunch of investors.

In this release, we are introducing some new features to complement the release of iOS 18, along with a new way to configure your Home Assistant Apple Watch app.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Dark and tinted app icons</h2>\n<p>Within the iOS update rolling out today, Apple has introduced home screen customization for app icons. This includes a new dark mode variant and a tinted option where the user can choose an accent color for the icon. Of course Home Assistant joined the party.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-09-16/new-icons.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Dark and tinted variants are available for the main App Icon and some custom icons\">Dark and tinted variants are available for the main App Icon and some custom icons</p>\n<h2>Control Center</h2>\n<p>The new iOS also brings a new level of customization to Control Center, for which we are introducing five new controls: Assist, Toggle light, Run script, Activate scene, and Open page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-09-16/control-center.jpg\" alt=\"iOS 18 Control center options\" /></p>\n<p>With these options, you can use Home Assistant capabilities even faster, from asking Assist a question to running a complete script flow.</p>\n<p>These controls are also available to be used with the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro and 16 series. In the <a href=\"/blog/2024/05/22/companion-app-for-ios-20245-assist/\">previous release blog</a>, we discussed that this was a great way to access Assist, in a very similar way to how you trigger Siri with the power button. Well, this release speeds this up significantly by no longer using shortcuts. Just check out the difference.</p>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"v7NXQJMUK2c\" videotitle=\"Comparing Assist launch from Shortcuts and iOS 18 Control\"></lite-youtube>Assist opening on iOS 18 control (right) compared to from shortcuts (left)</p>\n<h2>New Apple Watch configuration</h2>\n<p>For a long time, our Watch app was only able to display <a href=\"https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/core/actions/\">Home Assistant’s built-in iOS Actions</a>. With this release, you will be able to display scripts, scenes, iOS Actions, and more to come in the future. After updating, open the iOS App and go to companion app settings to find a new Apple Watch configuration screen where you can choose which items to display, their order, and customize the look.</p>\n<p>A really useful customization is the <strong>Require confirmation</strong> option, which will prompt you with a confirmation popup before running the item. This will be very helpful if you, like me, have bad aim and accidentally open your garage door instead of turning on your TV.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-09-16/watch.png\" alt=\"New Apple Watch configuration\" /></p>\n<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re introducing new sensors, including Apple Watch battery level and state, app version, and location permission category.</li>\n<li>A new Scripts home screen widget.</li>\n<li>We’re working on adding Assist to the Apple Watch, try it out today, but be aware it’s still in beta.</li>\n<li>Several bug fixes are included in this version,\n<ul>\n<li>Preventing widgets not working on iOS 15/16.</li>\n<li>Allowing Watch LTE to run actions while far away from your iPhone (requires location permissions being enabled).</li>\n<li>Fixing the black status bar when running older versions of Core.</li>\n<li>Addressing gauge and details lock screen widgets crashing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Need help?

Home Assistant releases have continued to grow for some time, and this one might not be as gargantuan in size as previous releases, but it still packs some really cool features and announcements.</p>\n<p>This release includes bigger sections, smarter energy monitoring, and a new LLM option. We’ve added <a href=\"#new-integrations\">five</a> new integrations, along with <a href=\"#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui\">one</a> existing integration being added to the UI. On top of all that, we’ve announced a new Works with Home Assistant partner, and the culmination of a project to ensure our project is truly open source.</p>\n<p>We hope you’ve been able to enjoy some time in, and away, from your smart home this month as well.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the release!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#sections-go-big\">Sections go BIG</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#wider-sections\">Wider sections</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#full-span-cards\">Full span cards</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#badges\">Badges</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#tracking-your-untracked-energy\">Tracking your untracked energy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#llm-agent-options-grow\">LLM agent options grow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#aqara-joins-works-with-home-assistant\">Aqara joins Works with Home Assistant</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#open-source-compliance\">Open source compliance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#integrations\">Integrations</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#new-integrations\">New integrations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#noteworthy-improvements-to-existing-integrations\">Noteworthy improvements to existing integrations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui\">Now available to set up from the UI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#farewell-to-the-following\">Farewell to the following</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#patch-releases\">Patch releases</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#202491---september-6\">2024.9.1 - September 6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#202492---september-16\">2024.9.2 - September 16</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#202493---september-24\">2024.9.3 - September 24</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#need-help-join-the-community\">Need help?

These powerful customization features can affect the <a href=\"/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#drag-and-drop-rearrangement-of-cards-and-sections\">predictability of where cards or sections will go</a>, especially when switching between desktop and mobile views, and we have found it works best with large cards. As always, the choice of how to use it is up to you.</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/2024-09/sections-before.png\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"Screenshot showing sections that are all 1 section wide, on the right showing a section that is 2 sections wide.\">\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/2024-09/sections-after.png\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"Screenshots showing a section that is 2 sections wide.\">\n</div>\n<h3>Wider sections</h3>\n<p>Sections can be expanded to span multiple sections. Now you can, for example, have your security camera feed span two sections or have a massive three-section wide map.</p>\n<p>Cards and sections will continue to follow the <a href=\"/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#drag-and-drop-rearrangement-of-cards-and-sections\">Z-Grid rules</a>, which can lead to blank spaces if the new wider sections don’t fit on a specific part of the screen. If you don’t like those blank spaces between sections, you can choose a <em>dense</em> layout. A dense section layout option will attempt to follow the Z-Grid rules, but will fill blank spaces whenever possible. This can affect the order and predictability of your sections, but will maximize screen real estate.</p>\n<p>When switching to smaller screens, these larger sections will revert to one section wide (if this causes issues for certain big cards, we would recommend using our device <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#control-visibility-of-cards\">visibility settings</a>).</p>\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-09/section-settings.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the section settings\">\n<h3>Full span cards</h3>\n<p>Larger sections mean larger cards. Instead of just stretching out the layout of a card, there is also a new option on cards to have them always use the full width of the section.</p>\n<h3>Badges</h3>\n<p>Talking about dashboards, the newly styled badges we <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#new-badges-for-your-dashboard\">introduced</a> in last release, are now more configurable.</p>\n<p>Instead of using display mode, you can decide for yourself what element you want to show. This allows you, for example, to hide the icon of an badge and only show the state of the device you want to show in your badge.</p>\n<h2>Tracking your untracked energy</h2>\n<p>In April, we introduced a <a href=\"/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#new-energy-graph-for-individual-devices\">new energy graph for individual devices</a> in our energy dashboard. This allows you to aggregate all your energy monitoring into one graph, giving you a quick way to see your house’s biggest energy-using devices. Big thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a>, the original creator of this graph, who has now updated it.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-09/untracked-energy.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the individual device energy graph\">\n<p>We can’t all have energy tracking for every device, and if you have whole-home energy tracking (like a smart meter or <a href=\"/home-energy-management\">something more DIY</a>) the updated graph will calculate the difference and show your home’s untracked usage. So hop onto your <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/energy/\">energy dashboard</a> and start to tackle your phantom energy load.</p>\n<h2>LLM agent options grow</h2>\n<p>When we added the ability to use <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#dipping-our-toes-in-the-world-of-ai-using-llms\">Large Language Models (LLMs)</a> in our Voice Assistant, it began with a limited number of conversation agents. These included the cloud-based  <a href=\"/components/openai_conversation/\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"/components/google_generative_ai_conversation/\">Google AI</a> integrations, along with the locally-run <a href=\"/integrations/ollama/\">Ollama</a> integration. All three can now control the devices in your home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Shulyaka\">@Shulyaka</a> has now added another cloud option with <a href=\"/integrations/anthropic\">Anthropic</a> - thanks again for giving us another option for experimenting with AI in Home Assistant. Setting it up can be a little different than other conversation agents, so take a look at the <a href=\"/integrations/anthropic\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>We have updated our <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports\">LLM leaderboard</a> to include Anthropic. Both Claude 3 Haiku and Claude 3 Sonnet score very high on our benchmarks and now rank among the top. Based on the results of the benchmark, we have set the cheaper Claude 3 Haiku as the default model for the Anthropic integration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter\">@allenporter</a> added the ability to configure the context window size of the <a href=\"/integrations/ollama\">Ollama</a> integration. The default size was increased, making it perform 20% better!</p>\n<h2>Aqara joins Works with Home Assistant</h2>\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-09-aqara-wwha/art.jpg\" alt=\"Aqara join Works via Matter with Home Assistant\">\n<p>We <a href=\"/blog/2024/09/03/aqara-joins-works-with-home-assistant/\">recently announced</a> that four Aqara devices are joining our <a href=\"https://partner.home-assistant.io/\">Works with Home Assistant</a> program.  What’s really exciting is that these are all Matter devices, and Aqara will be the first partner to use our “Works via Matter with Home Assistant” badge, giving some great options to use with Home Assistant’s amazing Matter integration.</p>\n<p>What’s more, this will be the first partner to join since <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/08/works-with-home-assistant-becomes-part-ohf/\">our recent update to the program</a>, meaning device-by-device certification that we tested ourselves. This makes it really easy to see what will give you the best experience in Home Assistant.</p>\n<h2>Open source compliance</h2>\n<p>We have put a lot of work into making sure that Home Assistant is truly open source, from top to bottom. This means ensuring that every library our integrations rely on uses the compliant license. We’re now at more than 2,800 integrations, so as you can imagine, this was not a small task. Working with code owners and library developers, we have painstakingly checked that every library is now using an <a href=\"https://opensource.org/license\">OSI-approved license</a>.</p>\n<p>This might seem like a small procedural thing, but it is critical to keep integrations and Home Assistant functional far into the future. If you’re not aware, libraries are what many device and service integrations rely on to function, by calling in additional protocol specific code that <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api_lib_index/\">purposely</a> sits outside of the Home Assistant project. If an individual or corporation can no longer maintain libraries, a proper open source license allows it to be picked up and continued by others.</p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

It will also be the first partner to use our “Works via Matter with Home Assistant” badge, giving some great options to use with Home Assistant’s <a href=\"https://www.matteralpha.com/news/new-home-assistant-update-matter-1-3-ai-automation\">industry-leading Matter support</a>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Matter materializes</h2>\n<p>Aqara has been an early adopter of Matter, and many of its new products support the standard, which is great for <a href=\"/blog/2024/01/25/matter-livestream-blog/\">connecting to Home Assistant</a>. Matter allows for local control by directly connecting devices to Home Assistant, keeping your smart home data in your home. Matter is a completely local IP-based protocol that leverages your existing Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks, but it can also use <a href=\"/integrations/thread/\">Thread</a>, which many Aqara devices take advantage of. Thread devices can be directly connected to Home Assistant using a <a href=\"/connectzbt1\">Connect ZBT-1</a>, or can be connected to Home Assistant via an existing hub (Thread Border Router) you may already have from another <a href=\"/integrations/thread#google\">smart home ecosystem</a>, including the Aqara Hub M3.</p>\n<p>One superpower of Matter compared to other standards is being able to control these devices with multiple different ecosystems simultaneously. For instance, an Aqara lock could be unlocked with a Home Assistant automation and then locked with a voice command directed to an Apple Homepod.</p>\n<h2>Devices joining the program</h2>\n<p>Aqara has had the following three devices Works with Home Assistant certified. All of which can be directly connected to Home Assistant without an account.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aqara.com/en/product/motion-and-light-sensor-p2/\">Motion and Light Sensor P2</a> - Matter over Thread battery-powered motion and lux sensor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aqara.com/en/product/door-and-window-sensor-p2/\">Door and Window Sensor P2</a> - Matter over Thread battery-powered cover sensor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aqara.com/en/product/smart-lock-u200/\">Smart Lock U200</a> - Matter over Thread battery-powered lock.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’re also testing the yet-to-be-launched Smart Lock U300, which we hope to see added soon.</p>\n<p>We have also certified a hub that makes it easy to connect an existing Aqara-based smart home to Home Assistant using Matter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.aqara.com/en/product/hub-m3/\">Hub M3</a> - It has many functions, but we have certified it as a Matter Bridge. This means you can use it to bridge your existing Aqara Zigbee devices to Matter. It can also act as a Thread Border Router for Home Assistant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have some Aqara products that are not listed above, rest assured that they will continue to work as they always have. The program is a way to clearly indicate which devices provide the best experience with Home Assistant. We’ve ensured this by testing these devices’ compatibility ourselves. We also get assurances from the brand that they will provide responsive support and maintenance, while being a positive brand in the Home Assistant community.</p>\n<p>Works with Home Assistant is now run by the non-profit <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, which means it is not a profit-making endeavor. It is about encouraging brands to go above and beyond in the Home Assistant community, and we’re excited to have Aqara join.</p>\n<p>When shopping for devices to connect to your home, we recommend first looking at our Works with Home Assistant partner’s products. These products always prioritize long-term support and local control.</p>\n",

This follows HACS being added as an <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a> collaboration partner, recognizing its important role in Home Assistant’s open ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Just note, HACS is an advanced tool that can add custom code to your Home Assistant install, which can cause issues on your Home Assistant system. If you are a beginner or prioritize stability above all else, <a href=\"#how-to-install\">HACS might not be for you</a>.</p>\n<h2>Jump to sections <!-- omit from toc --></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#hacs-reaches-v20\">HACS reaches v2.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-hacs\">What is HACS?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#why-use-hacs\">Why use HACS?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#a-brief-history-of-hacs\">A Brief History of HACS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-install\">How to install</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Want to skip the blog and just start playing with HACS 2.0?</strong></em> Just remember to proceed with caution and do not skip the backup step before you <a href=\"#how-to-install\">install</a>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>HACS reaches v2.0</h2>\n<p>This is one of the biggest updates yet for HACS, but if you’re not sure what HACS is or why you might consider using it, check out our <a href=\"#what-is-hacs\">explainer below</a>.</p>\n<h3>New frontend <!-- omit from toc --></h3>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-08-hacs2/frontend.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"HACS frontend looks like data tables\">\n<p>HACS 2.0 <a href=\"https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/repositories/dashboard/\">main dashboard</a> has taken cues from Home Assistant, and now closely matches the native look and functionality of the data tables you find on the entities or automation pages. This includes the options to filter, group, sort, and search.</p>\n<h3>Faster downloads <!-- omit from toc --></h3>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-08-hacs2/downloads.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"HDownload window going very fast\">\n<p>Previously, HACS 100% relied on GitHub to retrieve information, from file locations to the number of stars, so we needed to limit the API (as there are a lot of HACS users). To speed things up, we’ve created a <a href=\"https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/data_sources/\">remote dataset</a> stored in Cloudflare R2 buckets, which are updated at regular intervals.  Files are still downloaded from GitHub and their API is still contacted, but it will see drastically fewer calls, and the speed improvement is massive. Behind the scenes, this was a big piece of work, which has ongoing costs, and shows the kind of support the Open Home Foundation can provide to a community-driven project like HACS.</p>\n<h3>Update and repair <!-- omit from toc --></h3>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-08-hacs2/updates-repairs.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"update all your Home Assistant from the same place\">\n<p>No more visiting the HACS page every day to check for updates. They’ll now appear in the same places system and add-on <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/updates/\">updates</a> appear in the native Home Assistant format. Also, once they’re finished updating, they will give you suggested repairs (for instance, reloading the dashboards or rebooting Home Assistant).</p>\n<h3>Other improvements <!-- omit from toc --></h3>\n<p>We have also renamed things to help them make more sense, including changing “category” to “type”, and “Lovelace” to “dashboard” (Lovelace needs to make room for <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#what-is-project-grace\">Grace</a>). We’re also including Template management, which utilizes the new <a href=\"https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/publish/template/\">template type</a> to enhance your Jinja templates.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-note\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>\n  <p class=\"alert-content\">\n<p><strong>Breaking changes</strong> - There have been some breaking changes, such as removing the YAML configuration, no longer including the NetDaemon type, and moving <a href=\"https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/entities/switch/\">beta selection to a switch entity</a>. Many of the changes are more likely to affect those sharing their code via HACS, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/hacs/integration/releases/tag/2.0.0\">release notes for the full list</a>.</p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<h2>What is HACS?</h2>\n<p>Home Assistant is built around choice, and HACS is the epitome of this, giving you access to hundreds of community-made integrations, cards, themes, and more. HACS isn’t actually <em>a hack</em>, as Home Assistant has always allowed you to add custom integrations and UI elements - HACS just adds a streamlined interface to find, install, and update these.</p>\n<p>HACS stands for <em>Home Assistant Community Store</em>, and despite the name it doesn’t sell anything - it’s all free and open-source. HACS is there for people in the community who write custom code to address something they think is missing from Home Assistant. It allows them to easily share this code with the community unrestricted via submitting their GitHub repository to HACS. This means these are maintained by the community members that upload them, not HACS or Home Assistant. If you want to learn more about what you’re installing, or report issues, there is always a link to the original code.  </p>\n<p>Just to clear up the biggest misconception about HACS, <strong>it does not install add-ons</strong>. Home Assistant OS natively has its own <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_store/\">built-in store for Home Assistant Add-ons</a>. Add-ons run alongside Home Assistant, while HACS installs custom code that can run in Home Assistant (which has implications for system stability, more on that below).</p>\n<h2>Why use HACS?</h2>\n<p><strong>More integrations</strong> - Not every device and service is supported by Home Assistant out-of-the-box, and HACS helps fill the gaps. There are hundreds of integrations on HACS, some are there because the authors didn’t have the time to meet Home Assistant’s requirements, while others are doing something not allowed by Home Assistant, like web scraping (which is sometimes the only way, but <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/issues/252\">not a good idea</a>). Just be aware that these decisions can come at the expense of stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced integrations</strong> - Some HACS integrations are more complex and advanced versions of their Core counterparts, while other integrations combine multiple sensors to provide new data points. Some of these “integrations” even give Home Assistant advanced new features and settings. It also allows for rapid development as it allows updates outside the Home Assistant refresh cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Cards and Themes</strong> - There are some amazing cards, UIs, and themes being built by community developers and designers - BTW if you’re one, <a href=\"/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/#process-how-can-we-work-together\">our frontend team needs your help</a>. HACS has made the installation and updating of these designs very simple and quick.</p>\n<p><strong>Scripts and Templates</strong> - This is the easiest way to share scripts and templates, while also adding the ability to push new improvements to users via updates.</p>\n<h2>A Brief History of HACS</h2>\n<p>HACS started in 2019 as my (<a href=\"https://github.com/ludeeus\">Joakim Sørensen</a> ) third attempt to build a community store. It started small and quickly became the de facto standard, with so many talented community creators submitting their projects. The Home Assistant team was supportive from day one, and even as HACS gained hundreds of thousands of downloads, we all agreed it should remain an optional addition to Home Assistant. Giving users the choice to add new features to Home Assistant at the cost of stability.</p>\n<p>I joined <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Nabu Casa</a> in 2020, partly due to the work I did on HACS, but I was hired to work on Home Assistant more generally, not to work on HACS. Incidentally, I’m not the only developer working at Nabu Casa who got their start on HACS: <a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya\">Paul Bottein</a>  on the frontend team built <a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom\">Mushroom Cards</a>, and  <a href=\"https://github.com/marcelveldt\">Marcel van der Veldt</a> who currently supports Matter development built <a href=\"https://music-assistant.io/\">Music Assistant</a>.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I continued to work on HACS in my spare time, but there were always aspects of the original version that limited its ability to grow. Recently, the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a> reached out to make HACS a collaboration partner, and provided development support. Numerous people were brought in to support, from across Nabu Casa and the community, leading to the large list of improvements you see today.</p>\n<p>Just before we released this big update, it passed 5,000 stars on GitHub! It’s the projects on HACS that make it what it is today, and I’d like to sincerely thank everyone who continues to contribute their code onto the store.</p>\n<h2>How to install</h2>\n<div class=\"alert alert-note\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>\n  <p class=\"alert-content\">\n<p><strong>Proceed with caution</strong> - HACS is not for everyone.  If you’re a Home Assistant beginner or are looking for the most stable experience in your smart home, HACS is probably not for you. These are community-made projects that do not receive the same rigorous reviews required of projects submitted to Home Assistant. There may be projects that don’t work or, even worse, break your system. Unlike add-ons that run separately and alongside Home Assistant, HACS projects run their code directly in Home Assistant, which increases the chances of crashing or harming your system. Before using HACS, always make a <a href=\"https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/data/#creating-a-backup\">backup of your system</a> and download that backup to another device.</p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>HACS should work on any up-to-date version of Home Assistant, it even runs on core installations. It also requires a GitHub account. If you already have HACS 1.X installed, perform a backup, go into HACS and then click the update button for HACS (note: if you update, there is no downgrading).</p>\n<p>If you’re a Home Assistant OS user here is the installation method (If you’re not using our OS, <a href=\"https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/#to-download-hacs-core\">visit this page</a>),</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make a <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/backup/\">backup of your system</a> and download it to another device for safekeeping.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Install the addon: Using <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhacs%2Faddons&amp;addon=cb646a50_get\">this link</a>, add the HACS add-on repository, and install the add-on it links to, <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhacs%2Faddons&amp;addon=cb646a50_get\"><img src=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg\" alt=\"Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of an add-on.\" /></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the add-on (no need to “start on boot”, you should only need to run this once).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to the add-on’s “Log” and follow the instructions given there.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once finished, reboot Home Assistant and navigate to the <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/devices/\">devices page</a>. Add the integration HACS, and follow the instructions to link it with your GitHub account.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>It’s installed, now what?</strong></em> Start downloading some custom integrations and UI elements. There are a lot of great community resources listing the best custom <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/c/projects/custom-integrations/47?ascending=false&amp;order=views\">integrations</a>, <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/c/projects/frontend/34?ascending=false&amp;order=views\">cards</a>, <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/c/projects/themes/29/l/top\">themes</a>, and more.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion <!-- omit from toc --></h2>\n<p>There are too many people to thank in this blog who have helped the development of HACS over the years.  Thanks for submitting your projects, reporting issues, fixing code, and just using this funny little side project. Most important to this all, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Home Assistant Cloud subscribers</a>. They made this update possible, not only do they pay my salary, but they also fund the Open Home Foundation, whose support was critical.</p>\n",

With this in mind, the program will move to the non-profit organization that owns Home Assistant, the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, which will ensure it is always aligned with the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/about/\">values of the Open Home</a>.</p>\n<p>Read on to see how we’re making several small but important changes to add more clarity to the program, and ultimately working to build a better, larger hardware ecosystem of smart home devices.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>What is Works with Home Assistant</h2>\n<p>When you want to add something to your smart home the choices can be daunting; we want stable, supported devices that are built on standards that last. We understood how hard it could be to navigate all this and <a href=\"/blog/2022/07/12/partner-program/\">set up Works with Home Assistant in 2022</a>, clearly indicating to users which brands provided the best smart home experiences and will continue to do so into the future. While also encouraging brands to step up their openness, compatibility, and long-term support.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-08-wwha-update/wwha-company-logos.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Full list of Works with Home Assistant company logos\"></p>\n<p>This program has been quite successful and now includes seven companies, including <a href=\"/blog/2022/07/27/leviton-partner/\">Leviton</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2022/10/13/third-reality-partner/\">Third Reality</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2022/10/25/ultraloq-partner/\">Ultraloq</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2022/10/26/jasco-partner/\">Jasco</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2023/03/03/heltun-partner/\">Heltun</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2023/04/11/homeseer-partner/\">HomeSeer</a>, and  <a href=\"/blog/2023/12/07/homewizard-joins-works-with-home-assistant-program/\">HomeWizard</a>. Our community regularly recommends the brands in this program, not only because they carry the “Works with” logo but because they just work. This seamless operation is because Nabu Casa tests devices and works with the brand to ensure their software meets our requirements to provide what we consider to be the best Home Assistant experience. They also guarantee when joining that they will address issues and maintain support with Home Assistant over time.</p>\n<p>We have had lots of positive feedback from the brands in the program. First off, if you’re already doing things right, i.e. focusing on local control, supporting users, and keeping software compatible, it’s relatively easy to join. It is also significantly more affordable compared to other partner programs. We want to connect our users to good hardware and help reward the brands that make the right decisions: win-win.</p>\n<h2>Open Home Foundation steps in</h2>\n<p>This year we <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/blog/announcing-the-open-home-foundation/\">announced the Open Home Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization that now owns and governs the Home Assistant project. It makes logical sense that Works with Home Assistant now sits alongside its parent organization, but there are other key benefits. Specifically, it is now clear that this program is not a commercial endeavor; it is solely here to encourage a better-supported hardware ecosystem for Home Assistant.</p>\n<p>Nabu Casa, the commercial partner of the Open Home Foundation, previously successfully administered the program. By placing the program under the foundation, it provides another layer to ensure the program remains focused on its mission.</p>\n<h2>The update</h2>\n<p>While we’re making this shift from Nabu Casa to the Open Home Foundation, we’re also taking the opportunity to do some housekeeping, improving the program on several fronts.</p>\n<p>From now on the program will be certifying individual devices instead of whole brands. Previously, an integration was approved for Works with Home Assistant, and all devices that could work with the integration could fall under the program. By making testing and certification device-specific, it becomes much clearer to users which devices they can purchase with confidence. We will soon start listing devices that have been certified specifically.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-08-wwha-update/wwha-badges.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Full list of Works with Home Assistant badges\">No brands have used the Cloud badge before, so no one is affected by its removal.</p>\n<p>The cloud badge has been discontinued and this is due to our belief, and observation, that all <a href=\"https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/all-cloud-based-products-will-come-to-an-end/\">cloud-based products are always doomed to stop working</a>, some sooner than others. Considering the <a href=\"https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/all-cloud-based-products-will-come-to-an-end/#:~:text=How%20not%20to%20phase%20out%20cloud%2Dbased%20products\">cases over the past year</a> of cloud-based devices becoming useless after the cloud service they depended on was shut down, and the lengths needed to keep them somewhat functional, we no longer believe the Works with Home Assistant promise can be upheld by cloud-based devices.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We want to see Works with Home Assistant continue to grow, ultimately covering every smart home device category, allowing for a home completely made of products that will give the best experience. We’d recommend users to always consider these products first, and also encourage more brands to <a href=\"https://partner.home-assistant.io/\">get in touch to join</a>. Let’s build a more open hardware ecosystem together.</p>\n",

In case you missed it, you can watch the 1-hour recording\non our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zmXLxQPr1o\">YouTube channel</a> or\nread the <a href=\"/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/\">recap blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>As part of our continuous improvement, this month we have fully redesigned\nand revamped the badges for your dashboards!</p>\n<h3>New badges for your dashboard</h3>\n<p>We already wrote about it extensively in our <a href=\"/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/#new-badges\">Dashboard Chapter 2 blog post</a>\nand this release introduces our redesigned badges!</p>\n<p>This is a big revamp of the original badges that have been in Home Assistant\nsince, well, forever. The new badges are designed to match the design of the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom\">Mushroom</a> chip cards, and are meant to sit at the top of a dashboard view,\nproviding a summary of the most important information that you need to know\nat a glance.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/new-badges.png\" alt=\"New badges sitting on top of a dashboard view!\">\n<p>These new badges match the functionality of the previous design but are\nnow even more feature-rich. Of course, they are fully configurable from the UI,\nallowing you to tweak them to your needs. You can specify whether the icon,\nname, and/or state will be visible, and you can configure the contents within\neach of them.</p>\n<p>Everything can, of course, be dragged and dropped in the order you like 😎</p>\n<p>Not just that, the new badges also come with visibility options, the same\nas we have <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#control-visibility-of-cards\">introduced for cards in Home Assistant 2024.6</a>.\nThis means you can show or hide them based on who is viewing the dashboard, what\nscreen size it is displayed within, whether an entity is in a certain state,\nand more.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/badges-add-visibility.png\" alt=\"Screenshots; left showing the add badge dialog wich include the custom mushroom template badge, on the right shows the visibility tab and options badges now have.\">\n<p>The best news of all? The new badges work across both the new sections view and\nthe old masonry view! 🎉 Heck!, we even have support for custom badges, like the\ncustom template one released by the <a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom\">Mushroom</a> project 🍄.</p>\n<p>If you have existing old-style badges today, don’t worry! They will be\nautomatically converted to the new badges when you upgrade to this release.</p>\n<h3>Optimized information density for the Sections view</h3>\n<p>For this release, we have also fine-tuned the design grid for our\n<a href=\"/dashboards/sections/\">experimental Sections view</a>.</p>\n<p>The height of each row has been reduced, allowing more information to be\ndisplayed on the screen. Hours of pixel pushing have also reduced the gap\nbetween the <a href=\"/dashboards/tile/\">Tile card</a> contents and its\n<a href=\"/dashboards/features/\">features</a>, resulting in a cleaner and more\nuniform appearance.</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/optimized-information-density.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the difference between the previous and current release.\">\nThe 2024.7 release on the left and this 2024.8 release on the right.\n</p>\n<p>If you have been experimenting with sections and have resized some of your\ncards, you may need to readjust the sizes to accommodate these changes.</p>\n<h2>Goodbye service calls, hello actions 👋</h2>\n<p>This release marks an important milestone in the evolution of Home Assistant:\nwe are saying goodbye to <strong>service calls</strong> and hello to <strong>actions</strong>!</p>\n<p>If you are a long-time user of Home Assistant reading this now: don’t be alarmed\nby this change, nothing breaks with this, and everything will continue to work\njust as it did before.</p>\n<p>In the 2024.1 release, we <a href=\"/2024/01/03/release-20241/#unified-actions\">unified the actions</a>\nin the Home Assistant <span class='terminology'>automation<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Automations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> &amp; script editors. The goal of\nthat change was to make our automation editor easier for newer users to\nunderstand by removing the “Service call” layer and terminology.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-01/add-action-search.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new add action dialog utilizing the search function to find whatever you need.\">\n<p>The above screenshot shows the UI that has been in use since the <a href=\"/2024/01/03/release-20241/\">January release</a>,\nand was very well received in general. However, the underlying terminology\nin our documentation and all other places in Home Assistant still used the\n“service call” terminology.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the term “services” in Home Assistant is overloaded and ambiguous.\nIt is used for both the services you can call in Home Assistant and services you\nmight integrate with, like weather or music services. In the latter case, we\nare talking about integrating with a service provided by a program or website,\nwhich is referenced in our Settings page as <strong>Devices &amp; services</strong>. 😵‍💫</p>\n<p>To make things clearer, we are now changing the terminology around\n<em>service calls</em> in Home Assistant from “services” to “actions” <strong>everywhere</strong>.</p>\n<p>Every occurrence in the documentation, the UI, the code, and everywhere else\nin Home Assistant, has been replaced with “action”. Unlike the previous services\nwhich were “called”, actions are “performed”.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/actions-developers-tools.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the developers tools, which also renamed all occurances of services to actions.\">\n<div class=\"alert alert-important\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:message-alert-outline'></iconify-icon> Important</p>\n  <p class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>If you write automations in YAML, you will notice that the <code>service</code> key\nin your actions is now called <code>action</code>. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"language-yaml highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-lang=\"yaml\"><span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">action</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">light.turn_on</span>\n  <span class=\"na\">target</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">area</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">living_room</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Existing UI-managed automations will be automatically converted the next time they\nare edited and saved. If you write automation in YAML, you can\nuse either <code>action</code> or <code>service</code>, as this change is fully backward compatible,\nbut we recommend using <code>action</code> from now on.</p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Sort data tables by created or last modified</h2>\n<p>You’ve added a new integration, a new device, or maybe just updated\nHome Assistant and wondering what new entities or devices you have available?</p>\n<p>This release will help you with that. Home Assistant now tracks when entities\nand devices, and many other things were created or last modified. If these are\nshown in a table, it means you can now sort them by the date they were created\nor last modified; helping you find those recently added or modified items.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/data-tables-created-modified-columns-sorting.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new created and modified columns of the entities table, allowing one to sort on these new values.\">\n<p>The created and modified columns are hidden by default, but you can make them\nvisible by clicking the <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:cog'></iconify-icon> icon at the top right of the\ntable. Sorting is always available, regardless of the columns’ visibility.</p>\n<p>You might notice that most entities and devices do not have this created or\nmodified data populated yet. Well this data has only started being recorded in\nthis release, and cannot be applied retroactively, but going forward it should\nonly get more useful.</p>\n<h2>Control Home Assistant using AI with Ollama</h2>\n<p>In the 2024.6 release, we introduced the ability to use the <a href=\"/integrations/openai_conversation\">OpenAI</a> and\n<a href=\"/integrations/google_generative_ai_conversation/\">GoogleAI</a> <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> to <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#dipping-our-toes-in-the-world-of-ai-using-llms\">control your home using Large Language Models</a>\n(LLMs). Many of you requested this to work with a local hosted LLM as well.</p>\n<p>Today we are happy to announce that Home Assistant now supports\ncontrol via local LLMs too!</p>\n<p>This is achieved thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/Shulyaka\">@Shulyaka</a> adding support for the brand new tools\nAPI in Ollama. The performance of the local models has been fine tuned by\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AllenPorter\">@AllenPorter</a>.</p>\n<p>Allen created a new <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports#assist-mini\">LLM benchmark suite</a> that is more balanced, less focused\non edge cases, and uses fewer exposed entities. We scored the different models\nwith this new benchmark, and the cloud-based models scored 98%, but local LLMs\ndid not do nearly as well.</p>\n<p>Through prompt tuning and fixes included in this release, we have gotten local\nLLMs to score a reasonable 84%. We will continue to test new models while\nimproving our prompts and tools to achieve a higher score.</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/ollama-model-performance.png\" alt=\"Picture showing the results of the LLM benchmark suite ran against different models.\">\nOverview of performance of Ollama running different local models ran against the <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports#assist-mini\">LLM benchmark suite</a>.\n</p>\n<p>If you want to experiment with local LLMs using Home Assistant, we currently\nrecommend using the Llama 3.1 8B model and exposing fewer than 25 entities. Note\nthat smaller models are more likely to make mistakes.</p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

They\nwill now provide more event types, allowing you to react to things like single\npress or double press events with ease.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://github.com/jvmahon\">@jvmahon</a> contributed support for select entities to the Matter\nintegration. This is used to select modes if your Matter device supports them,\nsuch as laundry, oven, or dishwasher modes.</p>\n<p>These last two features, are amazing improvements to the Matter integration,\nbut they are mainly a highlight. Many Matter device types have seen improvements,\nincluding more (configuration) entities and other improvements.</p>\n<h2>KNX can now be managed via the UI</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/integrations/knx\">KNX integration</a> introduces the ability to manage entities directly from the\nUI. 🎉</p>\n<p>If you have an ETS project file, configuring your devices is now more\nintuitive; you can easily select an actuator from the side panel and drag and\ndrop its assigned group addresses into the configuration. Alternatively,\naddresses can be found by name or number using dropdown menus.</p>\n<p>Create, update, and delete KNX switch and light entities directly from the KNX\npanel without touching any YAML. 😎</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/knx-panel-for-creating-entities.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the KNX panel that allows to create entities right from the UI.\"></p>\n<p>More improvements have been made under the hood. One of the most notable changes\nis the support for a broader range of Data Point Type (DPT) definitions. These\ncan be used directly within actions and triggers and inspected\nin the KNX GroupMonitor.</p>\n<p>Thank you for working so hard on this one <a href=\"https://github.com/farmio\">@farmio</a>; this is awesome! 🥰</p>\n<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>\n<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other\nnoteworthy changes this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are proud of our <a href=\"https://openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, so we will now show its pretty\nlogo on the Home Assistant loading and information screens. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/balloob\">@balloob</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#timers-are-here\">Timer support</a> using <a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist</a> for mobile devices. This means you can now\ncontrol timers from your mobile device or tablet. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/balloob\">@balloob</a>!</li>\n<li>You can now ask <a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist</a> for the current time and date, thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/synesthesiam\">@synesthesiam</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/synesthesiam\">@synesthesiam</a> also switched our voice activity detection to <a href=\"https://github.com/rhasspy/pymicro-vad\">microVAD</a>!\nUsing this we are able to detect the end of a speech command much better\nin noisy environments, even with music in the background. Cool!</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/dashboards/picture-elements/\">picture elements card</a> can now be fully managed in the UI using a\nbrand-new visual editor. Fantastic work there <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a>!</li>\n<li>Home Assistant will now raise a repair issue if a script can’t be set up\n(for example, because of YAML syntax errors). Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/emontnemery\">@emontnemery</a>!</li>\n<li>If Home Assistant finds an integration set up that has been removed\n(like when you remove a custom integration), it will now raise a repair issue\nto help you clean up anything left behind. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/joostlek\">@joostlek</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"/integrations/group\">Group</a> now has support for grouping two new entity types. <a href=\"https://github.com/joostlek\">@joostlek</a> added\nsupport for grouping <a href=\"/integrations/notify\">notify</a> entities, and <a href=\"https://github.com/frenck\">@frenck</a> added support for grouping\n<a href=\"/integrations/button\">button</a> entities. Nice!</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/integrations/generic_thermostat\">Generic Thermostat</a> and <a href=\"/integrations/generic_hygrostat\">Hygrostat</a> helpers will now be linked to the\ndevice that provided the actuator entity, thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/dougiteixeira\">@dougiteixeira</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gjohansson-ST\">@gjohansson-ST</a> did the same, he added a link to the <a href=\"/integrations/history_stats\">History stats</a> helper\nto the device that provided the sensor entity.</li>\n<li>You can now set up <a href=\"/integrations/button\">button</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/image\">image</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/select\">select</a>, and <a href=\"/integrations/switch\">switch</a> templates\nentities, straight from the UI. Awesome job <a href=\"https://github.com/dougiteixeira\">@dougiteixeira</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a> added a button to the actions developer tools to copy the action\nresponse as JSON for use in templates. Nice!</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/dashboards/picture/\">picture</a>, <a href=\"/dashboards/picture-elements/\">picture elements</a>, <a href=\"/dashboards/picture-entity/\">picture entity</a>, and <a href=\"/dashboards/picture-glance/\">picture glance</a> cards\ncan now get their image from the person entity! You don’t need to set a static\nimage to represent a person, it will now automatically fetch the person’s picture\nfor you. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Quentame\">@Quentame</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Integrations and helpers set up via YAML, now visible in the UI!</h2>\n<p>Most popular <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> and helpers can be set up directly from the\nHome Assistant user interface. However, we still have a lot of older or less\nused integrations that can only be set up using <a href=\"/docs/configuration/yaml/\">manual YAML configuration</a>.\nWe are working hard to move <a href=\"#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui\">more and more of these integrations to the UI</a>,\nhowever, this takes time and effort.</p>\n<p>The problem with these integrations is that they are not visible in the UI\nwhen they are set up using YAML. What we often see is that someone sets up\nan integration using YAML and then cannot see it on the integrations page,\noften resulting in questions in our community about where to find it.</p>\n<p>As of this release, we have drastically improved this situation. All integrations,\nregardless of how they are set up, are now visible on the integrations page\nin the UI. This means that even if you set up an integration using YAML,\nyou can now find it in the UI and view its provided entities.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2024-08/yaml-integration-listed.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the demo integration, which is set up manually via YAML, showing up in the UI on the integrations dashboard.\">\n<p>Integrations originating from manual YAML configuration can be recognized by the\n<iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:file-code-outline'></iconify-icon> icon showing on their cards.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we also have <a href=\"/integrations/#helper\">many helpers</a> that can be set up\nusing YAML configuration. These sometimes showed up in the UI, but often did not.\nWe have adjusted this as well, and made sure that all helpers are now visible\nin the UI, regardless of how they are set up.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-note\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>\n  <p class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>Things set up manually using YAML are still managed using YAML. This means that\nif you want to change the configuration of these integrations or helpers, you\nwill need to do so in the YAML configuration files.</p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Patch releases</h2>\n<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.8 in August. These\npatch releases only contain bug fixes.

Home Assistant Green is the best plug-and-play option for beginners.</p>\n<p>An important part of getting more people to use Home Assistant is providing great purpose-built hardware. It’s our goal to provide hardware that makes it easier than ever to start with Home Assistant, along with compelling options for advanced users.  In 2022, we began shipping our <a href=\"/yellow/\">Home Assistant Yellow</a>, and I’m happy to say that now in 2024, it remains our flagship hardware product.  We see a long life ahead for this expandable little powerhouse, and that’s why we’re streamlining our hardware lineup to make a bit more sense going forward.</p>\n<p>We will now only sell the Home Assistant Yellow as a kit and have stopped producing the Home Assistant Yellow Standard (our version that came preassembled with a CM4 and Home Assistant already installed). Rest assured, as the Home Assistant Yellow Standard’s hardware is identical to our kits, it will continue to receive the same support and software updates. The kits will continue to be available with or without power-over-ethernet (PoE).</p>\n<p>It’s not the biggest change, but we wanted our community to know - and if you want to see why we made the change, and how our <a href=\"#comparison\">current hardware compares</a>, keep reading.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>When we launched Home Assistant Yellow, we designed it with expandability in mind.  It includes an onboard Zigbee/Thread radio, M.2 for more robust storage, and USB ports to add more connectivity (like adding our future <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#next-priority-home-assistant-connect-hardware-for-z-wave\">Z-Wave device</a>).  Most importantly, you can change the core specs of the device by swapping the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4).  This allows users to increase the RAM, add eMMC storage, or even add built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.</p>\n<p>All this expandability is great, but we found many users wanted a more straightforward way to get started with Home Assistant. That’s why we created the Home Assistant Yellow Standard variant, which included a CM4 with Home Assistant already installed onto the board - unlike our kits there was no assembly required. This meant you could immediately start using it after plugging in Ethernet and power.</p>\n<h3>Green meets Yellow</h3>\n<p>Jump ahead to 2023, and in our quest to create an even more affordable starting point, we launched <a href=\"/green/\">Home Assistant Green</a>. Not only does it cost less, it better fulfills the plug-and-play role the Home Assistant Yellow Standard used to occupy. From a timing perspective 2021 and 2022, were not the easiest time to source Raspberry Pi products, including the CM4. We learned some big lessons about the added supply chain complexities of this kind of product, and it influenced our thinking when designing Green. Ultimately, Home Assistant Green being a better beginner option led us to end production of the Standard. Though the Home Assistant Yellow Standard is now out of stock at major retailers, it will continue to receive support.</p>\n<h2>Comparison</h2>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-08-yellow-lineup/green-meets-yellow.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Home Assistant Green and Yellow compared\">Home Assistant Green and Yellow compared - as you can see they're about the same size</p>\nSo you've decided on getting some official Home Assistant hardware and don't know where to start, here's a little comparison to help you choose between the Green and Yellow.\n<p><br><br></p>\n<table style=\"font-size: 0.9em; width: 100%;\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col style=\"width: 20%;\">\n    <col style=\"width: 40%;\">\n    <col style=\"width: 40%;\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Features</th>\n      <th style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Home Assistant Green</th>\n      <th style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Home Assistant Yellow Kit</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Best for</b></td>\n      <td>Beginners, plug-and-play</td>\n      <td>Advanced users, tinkerers, expandability</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Setup</b></td>\n      <td>Easy - plug in the two included cables, and you're up and running</td>\n      <td>Requires purchase of a CM4, basic <a href=\"https://yellow.home-assistant.io/power-supply/\">assembly</a>, and <a href=\"https://yellow.home-assistant.io/power-supply/#installing-home-assistant-software-on-kit\">software installation</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Connectivity</b></td>\n      <td>Ethernet via included cable</td>\n      <td>Ethernet via included cable</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Zigbee/Thread built-in</b></td>\n      <td>No <p>(Can be added with <a href=\"/connectzbt1/\">Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1</a>)</p></td>\n      <td>Yes <p>(Onboard <a href=\"https://yellow.home-assistant.io/guides/about-firmware-options/\">Zigbee 3.0 / Thread</a>)</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Expandability</b></td>\n      <td>\n        Good\n        <ul>\n          <li>2x USB ports</li>\n        </ul>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        Best\n        <ul>\n          <li>1x Compute module connector (RAM, eMMC, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth)</li>\n          <li>1x NVMe slot</li>\n          <li>2x USB ports</li>\n          <li>10-pin GPIO</li>\n        </ul>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Power</b></td>\n      <td>Included power supply</td>\n      <td>\n        <a href=\"https://yellow.home-assistant.io/\">Model dependent</a>:\n        <ul>\n          <li>Kit: included power supply</li>\n          <li>Kit PoE: Power-over-Ethernet, no power supply</li>\n        </ul>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>What else do they have in common</b></td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">Both are small, fanless/silent, have extremely low power draw, and solid performance, leading to a smooth Home Assistant experience.

Designed to sit at the top of a dashboard view, badges provide a summary of the most important information that you need to know, at a glance.</p>\n<p>According to our case studies of dashboards created by our users, we found that these badges are underused, mainly due to its outmoded appearance, bulky size, and the lack of configurable options from the UI. Instead, we found that many users are using <a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/blob/main/docs/cards/chips.md\">Mushroom Chip cards</a>, created by <a href=\"https://github.com/pittaya\">@piitaya</a> who also works at Nabu Casa, for similar purposes. Therefore, we decided to redesign our badges to match the design of the Mushroom Chip cards.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/new-badges.png\" alt=\"New badges sitting on top of a dashboard view!\" /></p>\n<p>The new badges feature a wide range of configurable options from the UI. For each individual badge, you can now specify whether the icon, name, and/or state will be visible, and you can configure the contents within each of these components: States can include multiple attributes to be displayed, and icons can be replaced with the entity picture for a person’s avatar or a media_player’s record cover.</p>\n<p>Visibility options are also available for the new badges, which allow you to show or hide them based on who is viewing the dashboard, what screen size it is displayed within, whether an entity is in a certain state, and more.</p>\n<p>Badges can be easily reordered with drag-and-drop, and they also come with copy, paste, and duplicate features that cards in the new sections view have. Last but not least, the new badges work across both the new sections view and the old masonry view.</p>\n<h4>Notes for card developers</h4>\n<p>On a default installation, we offer one built-in badge, the entity badge. However, you are not limited to that, as you can build and use your own!\nDefining a badge is done in a very similar way to defining a custom card. For more information, check out <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-badge\">our developer documentations</a>.</p>\n<p>We would love to see your new creations - perhaps a small sparkline graph, or how about a mini progress bar? What do users want to quickly find out on a dashboard at a glance, and what can you display in this small amount of space to get the message across? Let your creativity go wild!</p>\n<h2>What’s next for Dashboards?</h2>\n<p>As the new sections view matures in its featureset, we want to begin our focus on a bigger task: to revamp all the dashboard cards and bring them up to modern standards. To achieve this, we need you - the power of our contributor community!</p>\n<h3>How can we achieve this?</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time (I mean, Summer of 2018), <a href=\"/blog/2018/06/22/release-72/\">a group of developers came together to create the Lovelace dashboard</a>. It was built organically - developers contributed where they see a need, either for replicating a feature from the previous States UI, or for adding something that they use personally. While the cards that come with Lovelace are adequate, the usability and aesthetics left much to be improved. In order to raise the bar in our design standards, we need more design-minded contributors.</p>\n<p>Enter (semi) open-source design.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, open-source projects are built around code repositories such as GitHub. This allows easy submission of contributions by anyone who can code. We figured that we may be able to achieve the same for product direction and UX design, too.</p>\n<p>However, it is not easy to start with a blank canvas, and designers and developers have different workflows. Therefore, as the maintainers of the Home Assistant project, we are providing the product goals, the base design framework, and the process to facilitate collaboration.</p>\n<h3>Product goals: What do we want to achieve?</h3>\n<p>The goal of Project Grace is to make customization and organization of dashboards easy and intuitive for all users in a household. Dashboards are created to help users monitor and control smart homes, and as cards are the building blocks of dashboards, by extension, cards should also achieve the same product goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Monitor</strong>: Allow users to monitor the states of the device and service entities, with data visualizations that are easy and quick to understand.</li>\n<li><strong>Control</strong>: Allow users to control the devices in their smart homes, mainly with touch screens, and on the desktop with a mouse occasionally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To bring them up to modern standards, we want you to join us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Revamp existing cards to fit the new grid system.</strong> This will achieve the modularity and ease of customization we are looking to achieve with the sections view.</li>\n<li><strong>Standardize the design system.</strong> The new cards should adhere to the same design tokens for typography, iconography, shapes, dimensions, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Create new cards.</strong> This will fill the current feature gaps that we have not addressed.</li>\n<li><strong>Extend existing cards with card features.</strong> Card features allow every card to be more modular and be always up-to-date.</li>\n<li><strong>Incorporate existing popular cards on HACS.</strong> This will reduce the need to install custom cards and also bring them up to the UX standards of the Home Assistant frontend.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Design framework: What will our card designs be based upon?</h3>\n<h4>The grid system</h4>\n<p>The new cards will be based on the <a href=\"/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#the-grid-system\">design grid system</a> as defined previously, finalized with a few tweaks for better information density and aesthetics. We have reduced the height of each row on the grid to eliminate the empty space between the card contents and card features:</p>\n<p class='text-center'><img src='/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/card-size-comparison.png' style='width: 66%;' alt='Comparison of the old and new grid dimensions effect on cards'></p>\n<p>The finalized grid dimensions are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Row height: 66px → 56px</li>\n<li>Gutter: 8px</li>\n<li>Icon size: 40px → 36px</li>\n<li>Feature height : 40px → 42px</li>\n</ul>\n<p class='text-center'><img src='/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/grid-dimensions.png' alt='Grid size dimensions'></p>\n<h4>Design guidelines</h4>\n<p>We have also researched on the design of the Tile card, and here are some of the guidelines we have deduced from the research:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each card used for controls should have a clear primary action.</li>\n<li>Affordance: Everything that is designed to invite users to interact with should look clickable.</li>\n<li>Features get better results than icon buttons.</li>\n<li>Don’t clutter up the card.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for the rest of the design system, we have been gradually moving towards Material 3 for the past year, but we have yet to finalize and adapt it fully on our frontend. We would like to hear your input on how we can bring it to our cards.</p>\n<h3>Process: How can we work together?</h3>\n<p>Since open-source design is not attempted often, there are not a lot of precedents we can refer to. We are experimenting with our process and will tweak it as we learn more. For now, we come up with the following process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Working group, assemble!</strong> If you are an UX designer, product person, or a frontend developer, you are welcomed to <a href=\"/join-dashboard-group\">sign up</a> to be part of the dashboard working group! We pick based on experience in dashboard and card design and development.</li>\n<li><strong>Meet and greet.</strong> We will organize introduction workshops where everyone comes together to learn about what we can offer and define our project goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Start small.</strong> We will parcel out each individual card as a project. We will start with the easier cards first. Every working group member can work on as many cards as they like.</li>\n<li><strong>Research and design.</strong> We will quickly research, ideate, prototype, and validate our designs together, and share our designs and work-in-progress live on Figma.</li>\n<li><strong>Let’s build it!</strong> We will clean up and finalize our designs, develop the cards, and launch the new cards with the next HA release!</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Action items: What can you do as a custom card developer now?</h3>\n<p>If you have already created some custom cards, this is a great time to start upgrading your work to the next level!</p>\n<h4>1. Fit your custom card into grid system</h4>\n<p>In order for your custom card to work well with the sections view, you need to specify the default, minimum, and maximum width and height of your card:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Default</strong> width and height is the size of the card when it is first added to the dashboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Minimum</strong> width and height is the size of the card when its content cannot shrink further in size to adapt to and be usable with the provided area.</li>\n<li><strong>Maximum</strong> width and height is the size of the card when its content cannot expand further in size to adapt to and be usable with the provided area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our grid system has a fixed row height, which means that you can estimate how many rows your card will need by dividing the height of your card by the sum of the row height and the gutter.</p>\n<p>For more information on how you can implement the card resizing logic, check out our <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-card#sizing-in-sections-view\">developer documentation</a>.</p>\n<h4>2. Follow usability guidelines from our user research</h4>\n<p>Audit the usability of your custom card with <a href=\"#design-guidelines\">the guidelines</a> as mentioned above.</p>\n<h4>3. Create new card features</h4>\n<p class='text-center'><img src='https://developers.home-assistant.io/assets/images/dashboard-custom-card-feature-screenshot-8425524ea32eb5d4744a7557fcfcab33.png' alt='Card feature example'></p>\n<p>Card features are widgets that can be placed inside cards for displaying or controlling an attribute of the entity. By building <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-card-feature\">custom card features</a>, you can expand the abilities of many cards that support card features. You can also allow your custom card to use card features, similar to what we had done to the [Thermostat card].</p>\n<h4>4. Ensure features are editable in UI</h4>\n<p class='text-center'><img src='/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/card-visual-editor-example.png' style='width: 50%;' alt='Example of a visual editor for a card'></p>\n<p>The inclusion of a <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-card-feature\">visual editor</a>  is key to the ease of use of your custom cards, allowing more people to be able to edit and use them on their dashboards. Be sure to include only the necessary options in the visual editor, while also hide away the less used options in YAML or in an accordion UI to avoid clutter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>That’s all from us this time!

This month, we add the ability to <a href=\"/dashboards/cards/#resizing-a-card\">resize the cards</a> on your\ndashboard!</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/dashboard-resize-cards-example.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing several cards at different sizes.'>\n<p>Resizing is done with a very nice slider interface, found in the card editing\nmenu under the new <strong>Layout</strong> tab, where you can preview your changes. Make\nsmall 1x1 buttons or give a <a href=\"/dashboards/map/\">map</a> the space it needs. This is only available on\nour experimental <a href=\"/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#a-new-experimental-sections-view\">sections view</a>, which was recently released with drag-and-drop.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/dashboard-resize-card.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing the card edit diaglog, with the new layout tag and its card resize capabilities.'>\n<p>It works with <a href=\"/dashboards/cards/\">every card</a>, which gives users a lot of freedom. Most cards have\nbeen given a built-in minimum and maximum size, to make it easier to get your\nlayouts just right. If you mess up the look of a card, luckily we have included\na revert button <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:restore'></iconify-icon> in the\ntop left corner 😉.</p>\n<h2>Data tables improvements</h2>\n<p>Like the <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#data-tables-improvements\">last release</a> and <a href=\"/blog/2024/05/01/release-20245/#more-features-for-our-data-tables\">release before that</a>, we keep improving our data\ntables. We use data tables to organize information in our settings pages,\nincluding our devices and automations pages.</p>\n<p>With this release, we add the final big piece of the puzzle: The ability to\ncustomize the columns shown! 😎</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/data-tables-customize-columns.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing the dialog that allow customizing the order and visibility of data table columns available on the device page.'>\n<p>By selecting the cog <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:cog'></iconify-icon> in\nthe top right, you can not only customize the columns shown by toggling\nvisibility <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:eye'></iconify-icon>, but you\ncan also change the order of the columns by\ndragging <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:drag'></iconify-icon> them around.\nMaking it even easier to show the data you want, in the order you want it.</p>\n<p>Your customized columns and view are stored in your browser, so you only have\nto set them up once. They will be remembered the next time you visit the page.</p>\n<h2>Voice &amp; Assist</h2>\n<p>This month, we’re thrilled to bring more enhancements to <a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist’s</a> out-of-the-box\ncapabilities. We’ve added support for timers ⏲️ — our third most requested\nfeature for voice control — and the powerful ability to expose your\n<span class='terminology'>scripts<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Scripts are components that allow users to specify a sequence of actions to be executed by Home Assistant when turned on.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/scripts/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> to LLMs (like <a href=\"/integrations/openai_conversation/\">ChatGPT</a> and <a href=\"/integrations/google_generative_ai_conversation\">Google Gemini</a>) as well! 💪</p>\n<p>If you missed it, be sure to check out our recent Voice - Chapter 7 livestream\nfrom June 26th, where we showcased all these exciting developments.

As of this release, timers are available. This\nfeature allows you to create, cancel, pause, resume, and adjust timers using\nyour voice, making everyday tasks like cooking much easier. And yes, you can\nset multiple timers at once! 🎉</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/2024/06/26/voice-chapter-7/#timers-are-here\">Read more about timers in the Chapter 7 blog post</a>.</p>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"v3mNdTsX4J0\" videotitle=\"Voice timers with countdown text and loading bar\"></lite-youtube>Timers running on an S3 Box, with countdown text and a loading bar!</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-note\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>\n  <p class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>Timers are available today on <a href=\"https://esphome.io/projects/\">ESPHome</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-satellite\">Wyoming voice satellites</a>.\nTo take advantage of this new feature, update these devices to the latest\nversion.</p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<h3>Expand an LLM using your scripts</h3>\n<p>You can now expand LLM capabilities by allowing them access to (your choice)\nof your <span class='terminology'>scripts<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Scripts are components that allow users to specify a sequence of actions to be executed by Home Assistant when turned on.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/scripts/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>. This feature lets you precisely control what the\nLLM does in specific situations, while still benefiting from the flexibility\nand natural language processing that AIs excel at.</p>\n<p>For example, you can create a <em>“leaving home”</em> script that performs the actions\nyou want and <a href=\"/voice_control/voice_remote_expose_devices/\">expose it to Assist</a>. This ensures that commands like\n<em>“I’m heading out for a couple of minutes”</em> will run your predefined script,\nsuch as locking the door without turning off the air conditioning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/2024/06/26/voice-chapter-7/#expand-an-llm-with-scripts\">Read more about expanding LLMs with script in the Chapter 7 blog post</a>.</p>\n<h2>Take control of blueprint-based automations</h2>\n<p><span class='terminology'>Blueprints<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A blueprint is a script, automation or template entity configuration with certain parts marked as configurable.

Voice devices would pass on all audio to Home Assistant, which would listen out for supported wake words like “Hey Jarvis” or “Okay Nabu”.  This had the downside that your device, let’s say a Raspberry Pi, could only support a handful of voice satellites, and there would always be a delay in responses. We knew the benefits of wake word detection running on-device, but there was a lack of good open source options.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kahrendt\">Kevin Ahrendt</a>, a former mathematics professor, took up the task and created <a href=\"https://github.com/kahrendt/microWakeWord\">microWakeWord</a> in his spare time. It is a wake word engine optimized to run fast and reliably on microcontrollers. It was made for ESPHome, but it is available standalone and under the Apache 2.0 open source license. No one will ever have to pay for wake words ever again.</p>\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/NQIv3nsu7dE?si=9RZy-LpcRLiMjGg3&amp;t=863\">Chapter 6 Livestream</a> we did a deep dive into how this voice processing is possible on such lean hardware (we’re talking late-90s PC levels of RAM and CPU power). It was in this last chapter where we launched <a href=\"/blog/2024/02/21/voice-chapter-6/\">v1 of microWakeWord</a>, which at the time could only run on ESP32-S3 chips. A lot has happened since then, and it’s all <em>awesome</em>.</p>\n<h3>microWakeWord and Kevin join the team <!-- omit in toc --></h3>\n<p>We are proud to announce that microWakeWord has become a collaboration partner of the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a> (OHF). The foundation owns and supports Home Assistant, ESPHome, and our Text-to-Speech engine, Piper. The collaboration partner status recognizes microWakeWord as an important technology for the Open Home.</p>\n<p>Nabu Casa, the company behind Home Assistant Cloud, has no investors and its sole purpose is to serve the Open Home Foundation. The money it earns is used to hire developers to work on Home Assistant and other Open Home projects. They have been a driving force behind voice development and are building their own <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#current-priority-2-make-assist-easier-to-start-with\">ESPHome-based voice hardware</a>, to allow anyone to enjoy a privacy-focused voice assistant.</p>\n<p>Kevin’s contributions have already been incredibly valuable to our work with Voice. That’s why we’re super stoked to announce that Kevin has joined Nabu Casa, where he will initially focus on microWakeWord and voice handling in ESPHome.</p>\n<p>To support this work on Home Assistant, ESPHome, voice assistants, and more, consider subscribing to <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>.</p>\n<h3>3x wake words and 2x accuracy <!-- omit in toc --></h3>\n<p>Kevin has been hard at work on improving microWakeWord, and we’re happy to announce version 2, which will be included in the next ESPHome release. It runs a lot faster and with improved accuracy.</p>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"LbS3Udx36H8\" videotitle=\"Multiple wake words on a single esp32 device\"></lite-youtube>\n$13 Atom Echo running two wake words on-device!</p>\n<p>When we say the new model is faster, we mean a lot faster. Not only does it now run on the normal ESP32 chips, those chips can now run <strong>three wake words at the same time</strong>! We haven’t added this feature to Home Assistant yet, but expect to be able to trigger your Dutch and English voice assistants, each with their own wake words.</p>\n<p>The new performance doesn’t come at the cost of accuracy - it’s the opposite. <strong>The new model performs twice as well</strong> as microWakeWord v1, especially when you take advantage of its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_activity_detection\">voice activity detection</a> feature. We would love to benchmark our models against commercial competitors, but “false acceptances per hour” are considered by most companies to be a trade secret and not published.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-06-voice-chapter-7/mWW-v1-vs-v2.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Picovoice benchmark microWakeWord v1 vs v2\">\n<p>The graph above gives the results from the Picovoice benchmark, which uses hundreds of samples of the wake word from real speakers spread out over 24 hours with realistic background noise mixed in. Spoken English sentences that don’t contain the wake word are layered in to test false acceptances, ie. triggering when the wake word wasn’t actually said. We can increase the model’s confidence level, which makes it less likely to have a false trigger, but also less likely to accept a wake word. Across the board v2 outperforms v1, and in good circumstances it outperforms v1 by nearly double!</p>\n<p>Next for microWakeWord is to improve the accuracy for non-native English speakers. It will require us to collect recordings of people around the world saying the wake words. We’re working on a website to allow anyone to easily participate directly from their phone.</p>\n<h2>Timers are here!</h2>\n<p>Ask and you shall receive - in February this year <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/poll-what-do-you-use-your-voice-assistant-for-what-do-you-expect-it-to-do-multiple-selections/693669\">we asked our community</a> what features they want from a voice assistant, and next to controlling devices and responding to wake words, timers were the third most requested. This is just one example of how <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/\">our roadmap</a> is helping us spot gaps and build solutions.</p>\n<p>First the important bits: <strong>yes, you can have multiple timers</strong>. These short-lived timers allow users to be reminded of something after a period of time. For example, if you’re boiling eggs, you can set a timer to remind you to take the eggs out. Each timer has a duration, and optionally a name.</p>\n<p>Users can use their voice to create, cancel, pause, resume, and change the duration of a timer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Create a timer for 5 minutes”</li>\n<li>“Create a 15-minute timer for pizza”</li>\n<li>“Cancel my timer”</li>\n<li>“Add 2 minutes to my 5-minute timer”</li>\n<li>“Subtract 3 minutes from my pizza timer”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you give timers a name, it is easier to distinguish when you have multiple running as you can now reference it by name or duration (“cancel pizza timer” or “cancel 15-minute timer”).</p>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"v3mNdTsX4J0\" videotitle=\"Voice timers with countdown text and loading bar\"></lite-youtube>Timers running on an S3 Box, with countdown text and a loading bar!</p>\n<p>Timers are available today on ESPHome and Wyoming voice satellites that are connected to the latest version of Home Assistant. If you use the firmware we provided for the Atom Echo Dev Kit or the ESP32-S3 Box 3, update to the latest version for timer support.</p>\n<h2>Timers control devices</h2>\n<p>While working on timers, we thought: why limit our users to just playing a beeping sound after the clock ticks down. What if any command could be executed with a timed delay?</p>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"rgf5t3vn7TQ\" videotitle=\"Using timers to control devices\"></lite-youtube>A timer controlling a light</p>\n<p>That’s why in this release, users can now allow <strong>any voice command</strong> to be executed with a timed delay: “turn off the lights in 10 minutes”. When the time is up, the text of the voice command is processed by the same voice assistant that heard the delayed command. Just be careful, unlike regular voice timers, these delayed commands cannot be canceled or modified.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn off the lights in 5 minutes</li>\n<li>Pause TV in 10 minutes</li>\n<li>Open the blinds in 5 minutes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Large language models (LLMs) are also able to create delayed commands, for instance saying “I’m going to bed early tonight”, might lead the LLM to send itself a delayed command to start the bedtime routine sooner.</p>\n<h2>AI in control</h2>\n<p>Speaking of LLMs, our Home Assistant 2024.6 update allows <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#voice--assist\">AI agents to control your devices</a>. This is part of our broader AI strategy we outlined <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/07/ai-agents-for-the-smart-home/\">in a recent blog</a>. It will be an important part of the future smart home, and Home Assistant will be the best platform for AI because of its focus on privacy and choice. We know it is not for everyone, nor is it ready for mass adoption, but we are making it available to experiment with. Give it a try on your voice hardware today, with device control currently available on both <a href=\"/integrations/google_generative_ai_conversation/\">Google AI</a> and <a href=\"/integrations/openai_conversation/\">OpenAI</a>.</p>\n<h2>Expand an LLM with scripts</h2>\n<p>To make it easier to expand the things that LLMs can do, Home Assistant 2024.7 (coming next week), will allow LLMs to access approved scripts. This lets you precisely control what the LLM will do in specific situations while retaining flexibility and natural language processing AI’s are so good at.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-06-voice-chapter-7/voice-script.png' alt=\"Exposing voice scripts to Assist in Home Assistant Voice settings\" class='no-shadow'>\n<p>For example, telling an LLM conversation agent that you’re leaving the house may result in some unexpected behavior, such as turning off devices you want to be left on. To fix this, create a “leaving home” script that does exactly what you want and expose it to Assist. You could also add fields into the script, which help further guide the LLM, like giving it different behaviors for short or long trips away from home. Now when you say something like “I’m heading out for a couple of minutes”, using the script it will lock the door, but not turn off the air conditioning.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Media Control</h2>\n<p>Assist can now control media players with simple commands like “pause”, “resume”, “next”, and “set volume to 100%”. While simple on the surface, a lot of complexity is hidden underneath. Consider a living room with two media players: a smart speaker that is paused and a TV that is playing. If the user says “pause”, the TV will be paused since it is the only media player that is currently playing. However, if the user then says “resume”, Assist will only resume the TV because it was the last media player paused.</p>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"pFmwY-k5IcU\" videotitle=\"Demo of media player commands of Home Assistant Assist\"></lite-youtube>Media control in action</p>\n<p>Media players can be targeted by name (“pause TV”) or by area (“resume music in the kitchen”). When not provided, the area and floor of the voice satellite are used to determine which media player(s) to target. So “pause” will look for media players that are playing in the current area, followed by the current floor.</p>\n<h2>Easier updates for your voice assistant</h2>\n<p>Our voice satellites are powered by ESPHome, our open source framework for making private, secure, and reliable smart home devices of all kinds. We are regularly improving our voice capabilities in updates and we want our users to have easy access to these new features.</p>\n<p>With the latest version of ESPHome we have introduced <a href=\"https://esphome.io/changelog/2024.6.0.html#ota-platforms\">Over-the-Air updates</a>. Following our upcoming Home Assistant 2024.7 release, users building a <a href=\"https://esphome.io/projects/?type=voice\">ready-made voice satellite projects</a> (such as the Atom Echo or S3 Box), will be able to update the device directly from Home Assistant without requiring the ESPHome add-on. These devices can download their firmware directly from the web, no building required.</p>\n<p><em>If you stuck around all the way to the end, don’t forget to check out the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLLO4u2Tbbo\">Chapter 7 live stream</a> for even more on voice!</em></p>\n",

Though it’s a new name and look, they have the exact same hardware, capability, and support.</p>\n<p>We launched Home Assistant SkyConnect in late 2022, a device designed to be the easiest, most stable way to connect Zigbee and Home Assistant together. It also came with Thread connectivity support, which was (and still is) pretty groundbreaking at its price point. All these years later, it continues to receive strong support and is a community favorite.</p>\n<p>Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 is the same great product we all know and love. Going forward, whenever we mention updates or features for Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1, this will also apply to Home Assistant SkyConnect-branded devices. Keep reading to learn why we changed the name.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Why change the name?</h2>\n<p>At Home Assistant, we love open standards because they allow you to connect and control devices locally while offering broad compatibility and longevity. In <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#open-standards-certified-quality\">our roadmap</a>, we explained how we are improving our already strong support of open standards, and this name change is just one necessary step in that direction.</p>\n<p>We are working towards building a new line of Connect products, specifically we are working on an upcoming <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#z-wave\">Z-Wave Connect</a> product. In future, if we see any product gaps with open standards, which require a more seamless and stable experience, they may join the Connect line.</p>\n<h2>What has changed?</h2>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2024-06-ZBT1/zbt1-packaging.jpg' alt='Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 Packaging'/>Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 packaging 🤤.</p>\n<p>As I said nothing has changed internally - the <a href=\"/connectzbt1\">listed specs</a> are identical. You do get new packaging, which we’re pretty proud of. The device itself has been updated visually with our current logo and has the new ZBT-1 name.</p>\n<h2>Which one should I buy?</h2>\n<p>Whichever is in stock, as they are the same.

If you’re not sure what a roadmap is, or why we aren’t just listing features and dates - please read our intro to <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-introduction\">Home Assistant Roadmaps</a>.</p>\n<p>There has already been a lot of great discussion about these roadmaps in the community, and we would really like to encourage you to give your thoughts in the comments of this blog - as they will inform <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-introduction/#how-are-roadmaps-made\">how the roadmap evolves over time</a>.</p>\n<p>You can skip straight to the sections you’re most interested:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#home-assistant-a-home-approved-smart-home\">Home Assistant: “A Home-Approved Smart Home”</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#home-assistant-cloud-peace-of-mind\">Home Assistant Cloud: “Peace of Mind”</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#open-standards-certified-quality\">Open standards: “Certified Quality”</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>~ <a href=\"https://github.com/madelena\">Madelena</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/jlpouffier\">JLo</a></p>\n<p><em>Big thanks to everyone who had given feedback to us throughout the entire process!</em></p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Home Assistant: “A Home-Approved Smart Home”</h2>\n<p><img src='/images/blog/2024-06-roadmap-2024h1/ha-roadmap-2024h1.png' class='no-shadow' alt=\"[Home Assistant Roadmap 2024 Midyear Update\"/></p>\n<p>The mission of the Home Assistant project is to become the best smart home platform that embodies the Open Home vision (privacy, choice, sustainability), powered by a helpful open-source user community.</p>\n<p>A smart home platform should allow users to observe, control, automate, and anticipate the key functions within a home, which provides safety, security, comfort, convenience, personalization, and accessibility to its residents.</p>\n<p>Through our user research, we learned that while Home Assistant is a powerful platform for people who prioritize better privacy and customizability, we also found that adoption within their homes is another story. Our users have often gone to great pains to make Home Assistant easier to use for other members of their household, either by using another app as the user interface or hiding any visible traces of the platform altogether. We call the adoption of Home Assistant by other household members the <a href=\"https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/open-home-approval-factor/\">“Home Approval Factor”</a>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in the roadmap ahead for Home Assistant, we propose that our contributor community and us, the core maintainers, should focus our efforts on making Home Assistant more home-approved.  This can be done by improving the touchpoints that all members of the household will interact with, such as automations, dashboards, and voice assistants, while maintaining the power and depth of the platform for our power users and admins. Our plan is divided into the following areas:</p>\n<h3>Dashboards</h3>\n<p>We have been hard at work renovating our dashboards since last year. Moving forward, we are focused on making the dashboard user experience better for all users.</p>\n<h4>Current priority: Make customization of dashboards easy and intuitive</h4>\n<p>With the new Sections view layout, better tile cards, and our incredibly well-received <a href=\"/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/\">drag and drop</a> 🐉, we have recently begun our work on making dashboard customization easy and intuitive. We aim to implement an intuitive and organized grid system for dashboards. We will need community contributions to update our current cards to fit the grid system.</p>\n<h4>Next priority: Make default dashboards more useful and relevant</h4>\n<p>Our current default dashboard gives our users two choices: Either list every entity the system is connected to or start from scratch. With dashboard blueprints, we know that we can make the default dashboards more useful than that. We will need your input to optimize them to display the most relevant information from the get-go.</p>\n<h4>Later priority: Improve privacy in user, guest, and public access</h4>\n<p>The inability to fine-tune access to Home Assistant by guests or other members of the family has been a pain point requested by many of our users. We want to investigate ways to mitigate this while improving the privacy of the household.</p>\n<h3>Voice assistants</h3>\n<p>Since last year, we have built our voice assistant framework from scratch with our <a href=\"/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/\">“Year of the Voice”</a> initiative. Now that the infrastructure is in place, we want to make sure that it will be usable for everyone (before the demise of Alexa and Google Assistant 😜).</p>\n<h4>Current priority 1: Improve Assist capabilities out of the box</h4>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/poll-what-do-you-use-your-voice-assistant-for-what-do-you-expect-it-to-do-multiple-selections/693669\">research has shown</a> users are most interested in us improving out-of-the-box capabilities of Assist, for instance, timers, reminders, and music controls.</p>\n<h4>Current priority 2: Make Assist easier to start with</h4>\n<p>At the moment, there are several things you need to install or configure to get started with voice. We want to make it easier to set up and onboard. There are already some good hardware choices to start using voice, but we’re exploring building our voice satellite hardware to create a more plug-and-play experience.</p>\n<h3>Automations</h3>\n<p>Automation is one of the cornerstones of the home automation industry. The ability to automate your home so that it does what you expect when you expect it is both fascinating and extremely rewarding for users, regardless of their experience level. Today, the automation engine of Home Assistant is one of the most powerful in the market. However, this comes at a cost: It is not the simplest to approach.</p>\n<h4>Current priority 1: Make automations easier to organize</h4>\n<p>As users grow their smart home, they will create more automation. Our automations are listed in a large table and can get easily disorganized as it grows. Earlier this year, we did a lot to improve the organization of automations, including <a href=\"https://youtu.be/g3Xo0ArcMaY?si=OrqvNDASLFvyKhEs\">labels, filters, and categories</a>, which in return not only made automations easier to organize, but also almost every table in the Home Assistant settings.</p>\n<h4>Current priority 2: Make automations easier to create</h4>\n<p>While we made headway earlier this year in making automations easier to create, we need a more comprehensive effort with a full product development cycle of research, discovery, ideation, and validation to confidently make design and implementation decisions. As of now, many seemingly simple automations can be too complex to create and debug, and there is a lot of room for improvement. We foresee that when this opportunity is done, admins and housemates can easily create automations.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Research</h3>\n<p>To make informed product decisions, we need to base our work on solid research. Therefore, we have been building out our research capabilities, both in terms of user research and technology research.</p>\n<h4>User research</h4>\n<p>In order for all of us in our community to make the right product, design, and engineering decisions, we need all of us to have a clear picture of who our users really are. Last year, we did some initial research, mostly focused on dashboards. This year, we want to get the full picture with complete foundational research of our users.</p>\n<p>Secondly, of the three Open Home values, privacy, choice, and sustainability, while we have a pretty solid understanding of choice and some understanding of sustainability, the idea of privacy can benefit from more clarity. We want a better understanding of what privacy really means to a home and its residents.</p>\n<h4>Technology research (R&amp;D)</h4>\n<p>Yes, large language models (LLMs) are a hot trend, but that’s not why we’re exploring them. We know there are very interesting problems they can solve in the home, and with the amount of data our users collect in their history, we believe that there is much power underneath Home Assistant yet to be unearthed and it is uniquely positioned to be the smart home platform for AI. <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/07/ai-agents-for-the-smart-home/\">Our AI vision</a> lays down the foundation for what we want to do with AI and LLMs next.</p>\n<p>In order to help AI make better decisions, we need a better understanding of the context of what each device actually is. To do so, we need to refine our information architecture. For instance, we recently rolled out floors helping Home Assistant better understand your house. This is no small task, but it could be vital in implementing better voice or even AI in the home.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Home Assistant Cloud: “Peace of Mind”</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, powered by our commercial partner Nabu Casa brings, to the many, the hard-to-reach features of Home Assistant usually reserved for power users with expensive hardware at home, with no compromise on privacy.</p>\n<p>Currently, Home Assistant Cloud provides the simplest and safest way to access your Home Assistant instance anywhere in the world and connect to third-party cloud-connected voice assistants, like Google’s and Alexa’s offerings. Our newest ability added to Cloud is the ability to offload the resource-intensive tasks of speech-to-text and text-to-speech. This allows our users to have power-efficient hardware at home, like the Home Assistant Green, which uses three watts and performs tasks usually reserved for hundred-watt home servers.</p>\n<p>For the next phase of Home Assistant Cloud, we want to continue to build features that adhere to our mission, as stated above. The theme for the upcoming initiatives revolve around providing peace of mind for our users:</p>\n<h4>Current priority: Hardening security</h4>\n<p>We want to harden our security, providing more control for remote access and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for your Nabu Casa account.</p>\n<h4>Next priority: Encrypted cloud backup</h4>\n<p>This would allow users to have a more resilient installation of Home Assistant, so if your instance completely breaks down, it can be restored from the cloud.</p>\n<h4>Later priority: Cloud monitoring</h4>\n<p>If your Home Assistant instance goes down, we’ll be able to detect it and send an email notification. This will allow you to monitor your downtime, and hopefully avoid more of it in the future, keeping your whole family happy 😁.</p>\n<p>If you are currently a subscriber of Home Assistant Cloud, thank you again for your generous support of our project, and please let us know what we can do to improve our service. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can check it out <a href=\"https://nabucasa.com\">here</a>!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Open standards: “Certified Quality”</h2>\n<p>We believe open standards are critical to providing choices for the future of the open home, and that is why we have put a lot of work into supporting current and emerging standards. They provide a way for manufacturers to provide broad compatibility, but they also provide peace of mind for users by ensuring the longevity of the devices.</p>\n<p>All our teams are currently working very hard on certification - we want to make sure all our open standards implementations are up to industry standards.</p>\n<h3>Zigbee</h3>\n<p>For Zigbee, we already have a well-established hardware solution via our <a href=\"/skyconnect/\">Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1</a> (formerly known as the SkyConnect). We continue contributing code and refining ZHA and Zigpy, the software powering Zigbee in Home Assistant.</p>\n<h3>Matter</h3>\n<h4>Current priority 1: Certification</h4>\n<p>Matter is served via our Matter Server, which is evolving with the standard, and we will continue to the first home automation system that adopts the latest Matter standards. Our Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 hardware also supports this standard via its support of Matter over Thread.</p>\n<h4>Current priority 2: Device Commissioning</h4>\n<p>There are still some big challenges that need to be addressed like device commissioning, which is currently overly complex, and we’re working with the industry to improve this.</p>\n<h3>Z-Wave</h3>\n<h4>Current priority: Certification</h4>\n<p>This year, we made several big announcements with our support of Z-Wave. We joined the Z-Wave Alliance in February this year and have been <a href=\"/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead\">working to improve our Z-Wave JS software</a>.</p>\n<h4>Next priority: Home Assistant Connect Hardware for Z-Wave</h4>\n<p>To build the most seamless user experience for this protocol, we’re building our own Z-Wave stick to connect devices to Home Assistant. This new Z-Wave stick will join our Home Assistant Connect family of products.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<p>Our roadmap is an open call for contributions in the product areas we are focusing on. It outlines what the core maintainers of the Home Assistant project will work on in the near future. This is a tool for our contributors and us, the project maintainers, to plan ahead for our collective future. As this is a living document, we will revisit and update our roadmap every half year.</p>\n<p>For more information on how the roadmaps were created and how you can contribute, please check out <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-introduction\">this blog post here</a>.</p>\n",
