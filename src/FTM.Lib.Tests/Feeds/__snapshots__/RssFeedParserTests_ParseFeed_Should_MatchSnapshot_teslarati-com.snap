As such, the company claims to have an advantage over other companies, like Google&#8217;s Waymo, and it&#8217;s betting big on the scalability of a future of autonomy with FSD.</p>\n<p>When Tesla&#8217;s FSD will go unsupervised is certainly up for debate, but the company&#8217;s recent unveiling of the steering wheel-less, two-seat Cybercab shows that it expects it to come sometime. Tesla also rolled FSD Supervised out to the Cybertruck for the first time a few months ago, and recent <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-semi-ground-truth-calibrating-fsd-video/\">tests run by the company seem to hint at a future release of the semi-autonomous software for the Semi</a>.</p>\n<p><em>What are your thoughts?

The company reached its <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-celebrates-japan-60000th-supercharger/\">60,000th individual Supercharger stall worldwide in October</a>, after <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-supercharger-50000-installations/\">surpassing 50,000 stalls just over a year earlier last September</a>. Supercharger deployment also seems to have continued at a steady pace this year, despite <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/\">layoffs affecting the charging team in April</a>. Tesla later <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-walks-back-supercharger-team-layoffs-rehires-executive/\">walked back some of the layoffs</a>, even going on to re-hire de Zegher.</p>\n<p>Earlier during the month of April, <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-superchargers-four-days/\">Tesla said that its pre-fabricated Supercharger units now take just four days from production to delivery and installation</a>. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-exec-prefabricated-superchargers-advantages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">de Zegher reiterated the advantages of pre-fab Superchargers</a>, primarily including that it makes installation more quick, higher-quality, and more affordable, while those savings were being passed onto the drivers.</p>\n<p><span class=\"css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3\">The never-ending hunt for efficiency matters to accelerate the transition to EVs,&#8221; de Zegher wrote in a post on <a href=\"https://x.com/MdeZegher/status/1856086182683369717\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">X</a>. &#8220;This is what shows up on-site: traditional build with excavations (left), vs pre-assembled Superchargers (right).&#8221;</span></p>\n<figure id=\"post-279392 media-279392\" class=\"align-none\">\n<div style=\"width: 2240px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-preassembled-superchargers-render-max-de-zegher.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2230\" height=\"620\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: Max de Zegher | X</p></div>\n</figure>\n<p>In addition to the overall network buildout, <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-v4-cabinet-supercharging-speeds/\">Tesla officially announced plans to start rolling out V4 Supercharger cabinets in 2025</a>, after beginning to roll V4 charging stalls throughout much of last year. The upgraded cabinets will give drivers charging at V4 stalls access to the higher charging speeds of up to 500 kW for the Cybertruck (or 1.2 MW for Tesla Semi) offered by V4 Supercharger stalls. Although Tesla hinted at this a few months ago with <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-trials-faster-charging-speeds-supercharger/\">trials of faster charging speeds at select Superchargers</a>, the news has been highly anticipated for years and will soon become a reality.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-supercharger-network-improvement-evs/\">Tesla has also been working on improvements to the Supercharger network</a>, including the buildout of more <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-ramps-buildout-pull-through-superchargers/\">pull-through charging sites for vehicles that are towing</a>, as well as making it <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-find-towing-compatible-superchargers/\">easier to filter for these sites on the vehicle&#8217;s navigation system</a>. Last month, the company also said it was aiming to make stall availability more accurate than ever, along with increasing long Supercharging cables, modifying stations to avoid blocked stalls from non-Tesla EVs with different charge ports, and pushing manufacturers to follow Tesla&#8217;s port locations.</p>\n<p>In addition, the improvements come as non-Tesla EV brands including Ford, Rivian, General Motors (GM), Volvo, Polestar, and recently Nissan, can now charge at Supercharging stations in North America using an NACS adapter. Although the added EV brands will increase congestion at charging sites, Tesla&#8217;s efforts to implement improvements to existing sites and to continue building out the network will likely be felt by Tesla and non-Tesla EV owners alike—and it should definitely continue to help accelerate EV adoption.</p>\n<p><em>What are your thoughts?

Hill didn&#8217;t disclose what tools would be used, but Tesla&#8217;s own software seems like the logical conclusion, given that the company&#8217;s vehicles are already being used in the loop.</p>\n<p><em>What are your thoughts?

The job is located at the company&#8217;s factory site in Fremont, California, and its responsibilities include overseeing public-facing media initiatives in accordance with Tesla&#8217;s products.</p>\n<p>Tesla writes as follows in the job description:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>As the Vehicle Communications Manager, you will be responsible for managing all external data communication relating to vehicle programs and coordinating efforts with external media. This includes closely collaborating with technical staff on vehicle metrics, managing external vehicle data to achieve consistency and accuracy, approving website content and enabling external media access to assess product.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Your work will include advising on new product target setting and assessing program developments as an early customer-ambassador. You will work closely with a wide spectrum of technical and business teams in addition to Vehicle Program Managers, Vehicle Technical Leaders and company executives to align on public facing data and help the world appreciate the impact of Tesla products.</em></p>\n<p>You can see the full Vehicle Communications Manager job listing <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/vehicle-communications-manager-228675\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> on Tesla&#8217;s website.</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, Tesla hasn&#8217;t had any kind of traditional public relations team, so the listing is certainly a shift from the social-media-only ethos held since late 2020. The dissolving of the PR department was expected to be replaced with social media, and Elon Musk since purchased Twitter and turned it into X, while many Tesla executives have also started to be more vocal on the platform.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also not clear yet whether Tesla will hire more employees to work under a larger umbrella of a press department, or if the company will keep things lean with just the Vehicle Communications Manager. In any case, many investors, journalists, and general enthusiasts in the Tesla community have called for Tesla to reboot PR initiatives, so it appears the company may be responding to these requests or simply preparing for its next stage of growth with such a team.</p>\n<p>Following the decision in late 2020, Elon Musk doubled down on his reasoning for the move, emphasizing citizen journalism and Tesla&#8217;s focus on the product as key reasons for getting rid of its PR team. Since then, <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-twitter-after-musk-execs-take-up-social-media-comms/\">Musk has regularly defended a model in which executives and employees directly respond to inquiries on X</a>, instead of a more traditional model utilizing a press department.</p>\n<p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Other companies spend money on advertising &amp; manipulating public opinion, Tesla focuses on the product. <br><br>I trust the people.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1387172830094233601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 27, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>In April, <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-us-advertising-team-layoffs-report/\">Tesla also launched widespread layoffs that included its advertising team</a>, just six months or so after the company had begun leaning back into <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-finally-commits-tesla-advertisements/\">ad efforts following a similar pivot away</a> to that with its media team. <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-launches-advertising-x-u-s-expanding-small-scale-strategy-elon-musk/\">Musk talked about launching &#8220;small-scale&#8221; advertising efforts</a> last year, and it has seemed to continue with that strategy even following the layoffs earlier this year.</p>\n<p><em>What are your thoughts?

This was confirmed by Thomas Krieger, the association&#8217;s chairman and mayor of Fredersdorf-Vogelsdorf, to <em><a href=\"https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2024/12/tesla-wse-neuer-vertrag-einigung-wasser-abwasser.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rbb24</a></em>.</li><li>While exact terms are still under wraps, the new draft reportedly features a <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/police-clean-up-anti-tesla-giga-berlin-protesters-encampment/\">lower water supply commitment to Tesla</a> and introduces new wastewater management rules. Tesla, for its part, has offered to release 377,000 cubic meters of water in the draft contract. </li><li>The draft will now be sent to Tesla for review. If Tesla balks at the terms or if further adjustments are needed, the parties might find themselves back at the negotiating table. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What they&#8217;re saying:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&#8220;We have sharpened our position.<strong> </strong>I think Tesla should be able to live well with the contract,&#8221; Krieger told <em>rbb24</em>. He is also hoping for a positive signal from Tesla by Christmas.</li><li>Tesla has voiced concerns over not being part of the final tweaks to the draft contract &#8220;since we were neither informed that further adjustments would be made, nor were these negotiated in our presence,&#8221; as per a company spokesperson. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Important Background:</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tesla already consumes significantly less water than originally intended, with Giga Berlin using up <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-giga-berlin-half-water-asparagus-farm/\">half as much water as a nearby asparagus farm</a>. This was made possible by Giga Berlin’s wastewater treatment facility, which is one of the largest and most modern in Germany.</li><li>Due to Giga Berlin producing less production wastewater, the facility’s <a href=\"https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2024/12/tesla-wse-neuer-vertrag-wasser-abwasser-verhandlungen-grenzwerte-gruenheide.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sanitary wastewater is more concentrated</a>. This means that it cannot be diluted and discharged into the WSE’s wastewater network. It also results in Giga Berlin’s discharge parameters being exceeded.</li><li>WSE has scheduled to discuss the contract&#8217;s fate at their next association meeting, potentially setting the stage for another round of talks if needed.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-16 wp-block-gallery-15 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://shop.teslarati.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"468\" data-id=\"278390\"  src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2-1024x468.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-278390\" srcset=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2-1024x468.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2-300x137.jpg 300w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2-768x351.jpg 768w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2.jpg 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@teslarati\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"278388\"  src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button-1024x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-278388\" srcset=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button-1024x500.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button-768x375.jpg 768w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button.jpg 1086w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

As per the electric vehicle maker, the Model Y actually became the best-selling electric car for the last 12 months in Harbin, China. This may seem like a minor accomplishment, but Harbin is one of the country’s coldest cities, which is famous for its icy winters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that Tesla’s vehicles are performing very well in countries that are famed for their cold weather shows that the company’s vehicles are not just comparable to the best combustion-powered cars in the market—they are actually better. This was despite the fact that electric vehicles tend to see throttled range in the winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-20 wp-block-gallery-19 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"473\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"279334\"  src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-a-473x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-279334\" srcset=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-a-473x1024.jpg 473w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-a-138x300.jpg 138w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-a-768x1664.jpg 768w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-a-709x1536.jpg 709w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-a-945x2048.jpg 945w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-a.jpg 1124w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"473\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"279335\"  src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-b-473x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-279335\" srcset=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-b-473x1024.jpg 473w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-b-139x300.jpg 139w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-b-768x1663.jpg 768w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-b-709x1536.jpg 709w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-b-946x2048.jpg 946w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tesla-winter-b.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be a variety of reasons why customers in countries with icy winters tend to love Teslas. Perhaps it’s their excellent driving dynamics that make them <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-china-highlights-safety-legacy/\">safe to drive</a>, or perhaps it’s their substantial standard features that make them convenient and comfortable. Regardless, Tesla has created a lineup of vehicles that are compelling enough for consumers even if they take some range hit during winter months.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-22 wp-block-gallery-21 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://shop.teslarati.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"468\" data-id=\"278390\"  src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2-1024x468.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-278390\" srcset=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2-1024x468.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2-300x137.jpg 300w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2-768x351.jpg 768w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2.jpg 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@teslarati\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"278388\"  src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button-1024x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-278388\" srcset=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button-1024x500.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button-768x375.jpg 768w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button.jpg 1086w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

These include the Cybercab’s two-seat design, its efficiency, and its surprisingly conservative parts count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the Tesla Cybercab Lead Engineer, the <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybercab-robotaxi-petersen-museum/\">Cybercab is a two-seater</a> because the vast majority of miles driven today are with just one or two passengers. Such a strategy makes sense, as Tesla could simply use its other, larger vehicles like the Model Y to accommodate larger groups that require a robotaxi.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"in-article-ad\"><script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4672671650557568\" data-ad-slot=\"7845413937\"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>“One of the questions we get constantly with this product is why is it two seats? There&#8217;s a couple reasons why it&#8217;s two seats. One is 82% of miles driven today are with two or fewer passengers. This product is meant to be of extreme efficiency. We worked really hard to deliver that. And the efficiency isn&#8217;t just on an energy consumption base. It&#8217;s on the concept of cleaning, it&#8217;s also on the concept of reliability and service as well,” Eric E. noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some great info by an engineer who is on the Robotaxi team! <a href=\"https://t.co/dNxfmW8tJr\">pic.twitter.com/dNxfmW8tJr</a></p>&mdash; TesAli (@alifarhat6_ali) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alifarhat6_ali/status/1864527866974884247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cybercab Lead Engineer also explained that Tesla’s <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-starts-hiring-teleoperator-robotaxi-optimus/\">focus on the robotaxi’s efficiency</a> also means that the self-driving vehicle will be produced with few parts. As per Eric E., the Cybercab has roughly half the parts of a Model 3 sedan. This is quite remarkable as the Model 3 is already one of the most efficiently designed vehicles on the road today. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Two seats unlocks a lot of opportunity aerodynamically. It also means we cut the part count of Cybercab down by a substantial margin. We’re gonna be delivering a car that has roughly half the parts of Model 3 today. It also means when you need to clean the car as a rideshare asset, you really don&#8217;t have to worry about navigating multiple doors, multiple seats. You really just have what looks like a bench seat, easy to clean automatically,” the Tesla engineer noted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric E. shared other important tidbits about the Cybercab’s design, such as its trunk, which is incredibly large despite the roboatxi’s small size. The Cybercab’s trunk is able to fit everything from multiple golf bags to two full-size carry-ons and two full-size checked bags at once. It is also designed to fit some bicycles depending on their size, as well as a foldable wheelchair.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-24 wp-block-gallery-23 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://shop.teslarati.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"468\" data-id=\"278390\"  src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2-1024x468.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-278390\" srcset=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2-1024x468.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2-300x137.jpg 300w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2-768x351.jpg 768w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teslarati-Marketplace-button-2.jpg 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@teslarati\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"278388\"  src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button-1024x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-278388\" srcset=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button-1024x500.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button-768x375.jpg 768w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Teslarati-TikTok-Button.jpg 1086w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us with news tips.
